**Subject Line:**
Market Research Capabilities One-Pagers - Methodology Depth Meets Visual Clarity

**Proposal Body:**

Hi there,

I see you need 2-3 one-pagers showcasing your market research capabilities for prospective clients. Having transitioned from visual communication to market intelligence consulting, I bring both research methodology understanding AND presentation clarity - exactly what makes capabilities one-pagers effective.

**Why This Background Combination Works:**

Your one-pagers must demonstrate research sophistication while remaining immediately scannable for busy prospects. That requires:

→ **Research fluency**: Understanding data collection methods, analysis frameworks, validation protocols (content credibility)  
→ **Visual hierarchy**: Making complex methodologies digestible in 60-second scans (presentation impact)

Most designers can make things pretty but miss research nuances. Most analysts understand methodology but create dense, unreadable documents. You need both.

**Relevant Experience:**

**Market Intelligence Work (Current Focus):**
- Raw signal collection from social platforms, forums, review sites
- Statistical validation using chi-square testing, confidence intervals, cross-platform verification
- Competitive positioning analysis and market sentiment tracking
- Executive brief delivery optimized for decision-maker consumption

*Portfolio samples show this methodology in action - see "Executive Brief" and "Intelligence Dashboard" examples.*

**Visual Communication (Foundation):**
- 5.0★ Upwork rating with testimonial: "Brilliant work, easy to work with"
- Clean, professional layouts avoiding generic template aesthetics
- Experience distilling complex information into executive-friendly formats

**Your Project Approach:**

**Phase 1: Content Strategy** (Day 1 - 1 hour)
- Review your existing capabilities deck and www.harkresearch.com
- Identify 3 core methodology differentiators vs generic market research firms
- Draft value propositions with supporting process examples
- Quick alignment call: confirm target client profile and key messages

**Phase 2: Design Execution** (Day 2-3 - 2-3 hours)
- Create 2-3 one-pager concepts with different emphasis angles:
  * Version A: Process-focused (methodology showcase)
  * Version B: Results-focused (client outcomes emphasis)
  * Version C: Differentiation-focused (competitive positioning)
- Professional layouts: clean hierarchy, scannable structure, brand-appropriate
- Simple examples of your work woven throughout (not generic clip art)

**Phase 3: Refinement** (Day 4 - 1 hour)
- Revision round based on your feedback
- Final polish and delivery in editable format (Google Slides or PowerPoint)

**AI Utilization** (As You Mentioned):
I'll use AI for rapid layout iteration and copy refinement, focusing human expertise on research accuracy and strategic messaging. You'll get polished deliverables quickly without sacrificing quality.

**Timeline & Investment:**

- **Delivery**: 4 days from kickoff
- **Rate**: $30/hour
- **Estimated hours**: 4-5 hours total
- **Total investment**: $120-150

This includes one revision round. If you need additional variations or substantial rewrites beyond initial scope, we can discuss at hourly rate.

**Why I'm Interested:**

Your firm does custom research (I saw "UK Supplement Industry" and other projects in your history) - exactly the type of substantive work I specialize in. Creating your capabilities one-pagers is the meta-version: showcasing how to present research methodology clearly.

Plus, I'm building my Upwork track record specifically in market research/intelligence work. A strong collaboration here could lead to research project opportunities as well.

**Next Step:**

Quick 15-minute call to:
- Clarify your target client and their typical questions
- Confirm key differentiators you want emphasized  
- Review existing materials and brand guidelines

Available today: 2-4pm, 6-8pm your time (EST)  
Or tomorrow: 10am-2pm, 4-6pm

Alternatively, if timeline is tight, I can start with your website review and existing deck, then align via written feedback. Whatever works best for your schedule.

Looking forward to helping you showcase your research capabilities compellingly.

Best regards,  
Arune

P.S. - I over-deliver on initial Upwork projects to earn strong reviews. You'll get more depth and polish than the scope requires.
