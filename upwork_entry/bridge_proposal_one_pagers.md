Subject: Market Research Firm One-Pagers - Intelligence Meets Visual Clarity

[CLIENT NAME],

I see you need one-pagers showcasing your market research capabilities for prospective clients. Having recently transitioned from design to market intelligence consulting, I can deliver both methodology depth AND visual impact.

**Why This Background Helps Your Project:**

Your one-pagers need to communicate complex research capabilities clearly - that requires understanding BOTH:
→ Research methodologies (data collection, analysis frameworks, insight generation)
→ Visual communication (layout, hierarchy, readability)

**Relevant Experience:**

*Intelligence Work (Recent):*
- Raw signal collection from social platforms, forums, reviews
- Statistical validation (chi-square testing, confidence intervals)
- Competitive analysis and market sentiment tracking
- Executive brief delivery (see portfolio samples)

*Visual Communication (Background):*
- 5.0★ Upwork rating for visual deliverables
- Clean, professional layouts optimized for executive consumption
- Experience making complex data digestible

**Your Project Approach:**

1. **Content Development** (Research Depth):
   - Review your existing capabilities deck
   - Identify 3 methodology differentiators (vs competitor generic research)
   - Craft compelling value propositions backed by process examples
   
2. **Visual Execution** (Presentation Clarity):
   - Clean, professional layouts (no Canva template feel)
   - Visual hierarchy: Key claim → Supporting evidence → Call-to-action
   - Brand-consistent design matching your firm's aesthetic

3. **AI Optimization** (As You Mentioned):
   - Use AI for rapid iteration on layout options
   - Focus human expertise on strategic messaging and research accuracy
   - Deliver 2-3 polished options, not 20 mediocre variations

**Timeline:**
- Kickoff call: Clarify target client + key differentiators (30 min)
- Draft delivery: 2 days (2-3 one-pager concepts)
- Revision round: Day 3
- Finals: Day 4

**Rate:** $30/hour (estimated 3-5 hours = $90-150 total)

**Portfolio Context:**

My samples show intelligence methodology - your one-pagers would showcase how to COMMUNICATE that methodology to prospective clients. It's the meta-version: research about how to present research.

Available for quick call today to discuss your firm's unique positioning and target audience expectations.
