1mhpc8z,forhire,"Rules Reminder + Updates: Low Quality, Commission &amp; Other Things","I was hoping to not have to make another announcement until we got more mods, but this unfortunately is getting pushed before that.  From this point on, any of these job postings will result in an immediate permaban. All but a few of these are already rule violations, but have been removed in a lesser degree with a ""second chance"". We're not entertaining these any longer, due to repeat offenders and the quality of the jobs. All but a handful of these are predatory, opportunistic scammers and have no place here.  \-  **Commission-Based Only Jobs:** We've had it up to here with this, along with the arguments of how ""they're earning more than $20/hr, give us a break!"" The rule is a blanket for all the crappy ones that may not be esteemed as yours. If you're not paying them a $15/hr salary along with the commission, it's not welcome here.  **Paid Posters + Accounts:** This is something we've already been banning for a short bit, but take this as the ""This isn't welcome here"" hint. Renting an account or asking for someone to use theirs to post for you counts as account buying/renting. Most of these are against TOS of the providers that allow you to use them in the first place.  **Vague, Low Quality Posts:** ""DM me for a quick $30 job"", or ""Need help with something, message me"" are not longer permitted. If you can't state what the job is so that a freelancer can understand if they're good for the job, that's on you. If you're doing it so you don't get banned or removed, that's no longer allowed.  **Intentional Hiring from India or the Philippines for Low Pay:** Otherwise known as ""South Asians highly encouraged to apply"" in code speak. I warned about this before last year, but now it is a bannable on-sight offense. This is still going on, and under the guise of ""sir pls, it's a decent pay rate for &lt;region of India&gt;!"" Or on top of that, some wannabe guru from the US/Canada looking to outsource his non-college stuff to a Filipino assistant for $4/hr, and ""mating"" us when we point out it's a rule-break.  We've already had the discussion of why these pay rates aren't allowed on this subreddit. We heavily encourage and point you to r/slavelabour if that's what you want.   **Causing Others to Violate the ""No PM"" Rule:** This is something we've always enforced since 2019 automatically. This is enforced with a permaban as well. That said, if your post is encouraging users to apply in the comments instead of sending you a message, you'll be getting a ban as well for making them break the rule. Read the room instead of mass-spamming your job across a dozen subreddits.  This includes codewords, asking for contact info or portfolio links in the comments.  **Promising a Job, but it's Guised Promotion to a Job Board:** We've seen this a dime a dozen lately; someone promising a graphic design job, but then pointing to a new startup job board/work platform. This is no longer allowed. Most of these are a Reddit account affiliated with the ""brand"" of the board in question.  **No OF Content:** That's right, we heard you! We've had it up to here with it now, and things like ""OF chatters"", ""OF girls"" or ""OF agencies"" are no longer allowed on this subreddit.  These have always been removed to a point, but it's gotten to the point that OF girls think that promoting their account is ""freelance work"" and ""professional"". That's not even mentioning how abusive and low-paying OF agencies are, or how discriminatory a lot of the job postings come across.   Note that legitimate jobs that require some NSFW things (novel writing, artwork, etc) are not affected by this. It's not our intention to stomp on legitimate expression or issues.   **Hiring Based on Gender, Age and Race:** This may fly in your third world country, but we absolutely will not stand for this. Unless it's a legitimate need such as a modeling gig or you need a voice for a game, you're not allowed to blatantly say ""Need female appointment setters"" or ""Hungry teens for sales jobs"".  On that note, you're prohibited from hiring minors on this subreddit, due to liability reasons. There's people who think hiring 13-year-olds for 40+ hours a week is okay.  \-  Read the room. Read the rules. Please.   And for all things sane, if your post gets removed or you get banned, ***read your removal message.*** We clearly tell you why you're banned or it got removed. Stop messaging us ""Omg why did I get banned?"" when you're told.  Obligatory announcement over. Happy freelancing.",23,14,1754340589,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1mhpc8z/rules_reminder_updates_low_quality_commission/
1luy872,forhire,[META] Summer 2025 - Hiring New Mods!,"Hello r/forhire community!  From repeated feedback and comments, we're aware of the moderation issues this subreddit is having. Primarily, towards low-quality, low-paying jobs that often have scammers behind them. We've heard you, and I personally have not wanted to step toes to try to resolve some of these issues. After a year and some of me being here, I have no choice but to try to solve these issues on my own.  Due to some different issues taking place the past few months, me and another mod have mutually agreed to expand the mod team to set things back on track. We need a roster to help get things back on track, and that's the first step going forward to fix the quality of the posts.  \-  *NOTE: This is an unpaid, volunteer position. Reddit community moderators are not paid any money.*  We're looking for approximately 7 mods starting out with the following qualities:  **Account Age/Karma:** We're looking for people who've been on Reddit for awhile. Minimum requirements are an account age of two years, with at least 2,000 combined (post+comment) karma. You're automatically disqualified if your account doesn't meet these requirements.  **18+:** You must be 18 or older. We do not allow minors on the mod staff.  **PC/Desktop access:** While Reddit allows mobile modding, we would like prospective moderators to have a full computer screen and a keyboard to work with. Mac or PC is fine, just something beyond tablet and smartphone access.  **Previous Modding Experience:** We're open to new faces, but those with previous Reddit modding experience are preferred. We will accept an unexperienced face over someone who may be part of a Reddit Mod cabal for community cohesion.  **Professional Freelancer:** It goes to say that ""Command should do every job once."" This is a community of freelancers, and would like someone who understands life ""in the trenches"" to be the one helping the community. You get being paid fairly, struggles of applying for a contract, why it isn't reasonable to design a logo in 5 minutes for $3. Those sorts of things.  **Respect the Rules:** We need someone who respects r/forhire's rules, and have no qualm enforcing them. If you don't want to hand out bans for bannable offenses, or are hoping to weasel in and change rules such as the required pay rate or commission-based pay, press Go and continue on.   **Past Track Record:** You must not have been banned for an offense on this subreddit. We will not consider warnings, If you have a positive community influence we'll consider you. Suffice to say a permabanned scammer on the USL will not be allowed to join.  **Self-Interests:** This isn't a place to get a power-trip, push agendas/gripes, be a bully or act like a nincompoop. Be courteous, be firm if someone's pulling nonsense. We don't want people who end up on r/BadMods and the front page for senseless, petty-driven nonsense. This includes things like intentionally removing posts for profit, acting out against users unfairly and using the subreddit to promote your own means, views and abusing your position.  **Varied Time Zones:** We're looking for a wide spread of users to help us internationally. Currently our most active mods are from the EST (Eastern Time Zone), and we're looking to expand outside of that. Our end goal is to have an all-hour overview.  **Fluent English:** The head mod team speaks English, and everyone else who is on the current roster speaks English. This isn't the position for you if you need to put things into Google Translate. Please properly type English, no mobile/text speak with zero punctuation and capital letters.  **Professionalism and Courtesy:** f you have customer service experience, you get what this means. We ask for that friendly extra mile here, as we know how it's a turn off to get smacked in face from mod teams such the bigger subreddits.  **Time Commitment:** We all have lives outside of Reddit and the screen, we completely get that. Right now we're looking at concentrated efforts of maybe an hour a day until the mod queue is caught up. Once we get everything going smoothly, you'll probably spend less time than that. We will adjust the mod team accordingly to reach this balance, so that people aren't burning themselves out.   \-  # How to Apply?  Simply drop a message to us in ModMail outlining your experience. Tell us about why you want to be a mod, your availability and how you fit in with the requirements. To make sure you read these, tell us about a memorable experience you had while gaming, or with some other hobby if video games aren't your thing.  We'll reach out to you with further questions if you're a good fit, and onboard you with a probationary period once you pass additional questioning.   May the odds be forever in your favor!",11,0,1752003782,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1luy872/meta_summer_2025_hiring_new_mods/
1n8zf8l,forhire,"[HIRING] - ROUND TWO - Web developers - NextJS, React, Postgres/Supabase, Laravel, AI Integrations","**My previous post got a large number of applicants, however 80% of the applicants did not provide the basic information I requested. A further 60% had irrelevant work experience or a portfolio composed purely of personal learning projects. No shade, I know how tough it can be to get started in the industry. At this moment I'm looking for people with genuine work experience in relevant projects using similar tech. Please do not apply if this does not describe you.**      I'm a freelancer myself, and I've got too big of a workload to handle. I'm transitioning into building an agency and would like to bring on a couple of developers to take on subcontracted work.  All client work I do at the moment uses React on the frontend, and then most frequently NextJS as the framework, although a decent number use Laravel. Database/auth is more often than not Supabase or self-hosted Postgres.  Majority of the work consists of building out SaaS MVPs, frequently built entirely around or heavily featuring AI integrations.  Unfortunately, a lot of the work consists of clients coming to me with something that was vibe-coded, and I either need to clean it up best I can to get it ready to go live or pitch them on a rewrite, but do be forewarned that vibe coded messy projects are the norm.  A number of client projects come to us directly from Replit, Lovable, v0, etc.  I am okay with you using AI, I use it all day long myself, but you must understand how to use it to deliver code that makes sense and isn't over-engineered, or full of security and performance issues.  Freelancers must be fluent in English and have delivered real projects for paying clients, using the technologies above. I am okay with only being familiar with one of the two frameworks, NextJS or Laravel.  Depending on your qualifications the rate will range from $20-$60/hr.  If interested please DM me your hourly rate, portfolio/github, your geographical location, and your availability in terms of consistent hours/week and start date -- **applicants who do not provide all of this information will not be considered, sorry**. If you have an existing Upwork account (or similar) please include it as well.  Those who are shortlisted I'll ask to hop on a quick 15 min zoom call with me to talk through the work and your experience.  I'll be looking to bring people on within the next month.  **PLEASE DO NOT USE AI TO WRITE YOUR MESSAGES TO ME. Sorry, I just can't stand longwinded fluffed up AI writing.**",2,4,1757059973,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1n8zf8l/hiring_round_two_web_developers_nextjs_react/

1n8z107,forhire,[For Hire] Tech Sales/Lead Generator Expert,"$15/hr - My process is simple straight forward  1. Define the target profile (industry, company size and budget indicators). 2. Research their website, LinkedIn or any available social channels to gather information about the company and the decision makers. 3. Collect necessary information that would enable me to contact them and populate it on a Google Sheet. 4. Qualify these leads by checking their website, social media presence, and search visibility. If a company isn't showing up on Google, doesn't run ads, or posts irregularly on LinkedIn, those are clear signs of marketing gaps. 5. Update the Google sheet with companies that fit the criteria, and email the ceo with the information I have found, and proceed to establish contact on his instruction. All outreaches would be tracked on your CRM of choice.  To nurture the leads:  1. I would research deeper to know in particular the marketing gaps I can find out, including website performance, social media presence and local seo. 2. With what I have found out, I would create an email sequence for three weeks (3 times per week). Then start with a personalized outreach, followed by the sequence of emails. 3. I will also include cold calling. Once they show interest, I brief the ceo with all details (pain points, signals of budget, and engagement history) so they can step into the call fully informed.

I'm a lawyer and creator seeking a designer to help create a **vertical, mobile-friendly infographic/pamphlet** about what to do when your car is being towed in California (based strictly on CVC §22658). The goal is to make it **easy to read, scannable, and visually clear** for a general audience so that they can refer to it when they're under pressure.  **I want to release it for free so people can be safer and have an advantage over predatory towing companies.**  **Project Details:**  * **Format:** Single-page (or endless scroll) vertical, mobile-first (1080x1920 px recommended). * **Sections:** The guide is broken into stages of towing (starting with “Before/During Hook-Up”).

Each section has 3 parts of copy:    1. **Quick Read** – bullet points, short and scannable    2. **More Info** – slightly expanded explanation (expandable upon click)    3. **Heavy Metal Lawyer Says** – legal/statute-focused version (expandable upon click) * **Visual style:**    * Clean, minimal, scannable layout    * Boxes or dividers per section    * Optional simple icons (car, tow truck, clock, map pin, etc.) and my branding tastefully incorporated    * Bold headers for each section * **Color scheme:** Open to suggestions — clarity and readability are priority. * **Content:** I’ll provide the copy (with citations where appropriate) — the designer just needs to focus on layout, typography, and visual hierarchy. * **Audience:** General public, mostly mobile users.  **Deliverables:**  * One high-res, mobile-friendly infographic (PSD/AI or editable format) * Optional export in PNG/PDF for web/mobile sharing  **Budget and timeline:**   $100 for first draft within a week, and each iteration within a few days after that.

1n83xy2,forhire,[For Hire] Tech Sales/Lead Generator Expert,"$15/hr - My process is simple straight forward  1. Define the target profile (industry, company size and budget indicators). 2. Research their website, LinkedIn or any available social channels to gather information about the company and the decision makers. 3. Collect necessary information that would enable me to contact them and populate it on a Google Sheet. 4. Qualify these leads by checking their website, social media presence, and search visibility. If a company isn't showing up on Google, doesn't run ads, or posts irregularly on LinkedIn, those are clear signs of marketing gaps. 5. Update the Google sheet with companies that fit the criteria, and email the ceo with the information I have found, and proceed to establish contact on his instruction. All outreaches would be tracked on your CRM of choice.  To nurture the leads:  1. I would research deeper to know in particular the marketing gaps I can find out, including website performance, social media presence and local seo. 2. With what I have found out, I would create an email sequence for three weeks (3 times per week). Then start with a personalized outreach, followed by the sequence of emails. 3. I will also include cold calling. Once they show interest, I brief the ceo with all details (pain points, signals of budget, and engagement history) so they can step into the call fully informed.

1n7gdrz,forhire,[For Hire] Tech Sales/Lead Generator Expert,"$15/hr - My process is simple straight forward  1. Define the target profile (industry, company size and budget indicators). 2. Research their website, LinkedIn or any available social channels to gather information about the company and the decision makers. 3. Collect necessary information that would enable me to contact them and populate it on a Google Sheet. 4. Qualify these leads by checking their website, social media presence, and search visibility. If a company isn't showing up on Google, doesn't run ads, or posts irregularly on LinkedIn, those are clear signs of marketing gaps. 5. Update the Google sheet with companies that fit the criteria, and email the ceo with the information I have found, and proceed to establish contact on his instruction. All outreaches would be tracked on your CRM of choice.  To nurture the leads:  1. I would research deeper to know in particular the marketing gaps I can find out, including website performance, social media presence and local seo. 2. With what I have found out, I would create an email sequence for three weeks (3 times per week). Then start with a personalized outreach, followed by the sequence of emails. 3. I will also include cold calling. Once they show interest, I brief the ceo with all details (pain points, signals of budget, and engagement history) so they can step into the call fully informed.

1n6enfv,forhire,[Meta] PSA: Protect Yourself from Fake Job Posts,"I’m sharing this because I still see a lot of new freelancers getting caught up in shady or time-wasting job offers. If you’re new, please read this, these are common red flags I’ve noticed (and others have pointed out too).  🚩 **Red Flags to Watch Out For**  **Vague + overpromising posts**  Example: “Data entry, earn $40–$120/day.” No details, just high pay for easy work. That’s a red flag.  **Suspiciously new accounts**  Not all new accounts are scams, but often these posts come from users with: - Only 1 post (usually vague) - No comment history - Recently created accounts  **Weird contact info, like WhatsApp/TG**  If the number’s name doesn’t match their WA/TG username, or the country code looks unusual, be cautious. Many scammers pretend to be “employers” but are actually just recruiters collecting data.  **Overly generic or copy-paste job posts**  Some posts look like they were auto-generated and not even reviewed. AI-assisted posts aren’t bad by themselves, but scammers and time-wasters often put out vague, incomplete, or overpromising listings that don’t explain the actual job.  👉 If you clarify with them and their reply is still vague or evasive, trust your gut and move on. Real clients usually know (or can explain) what they want.  **Fake “test tasks” that are actually the real job**  Some posts ask you to complete a “sample” before paying, like rewriting part of a PDF, doing lead searches, or transcribing a few pages. Be careful: if 10 people each submit a “sample,” the scammer now has 100 leads/pages done for free and will ghost everyone.  👉 Legitimate clients might ask for small samples, but it should never be full or substantial work. A good rule: if the sample looks like billable work, don’t do it without a contract or partial payment first.  **Ghosting or “collecting applicants”**  Some posts are just made to farm responses. They’ll vanish, never reply, or ask for “samples” before confirming anything. Don’t waste time if they can’t be clear up front.  If you’re unsure, **ask in the sub before applying**. Experienced freelancers here can help you double-check.  Hope this helps you save time and protect you. If something feels “off,” it usually is. Don’t be afraid to walk away. There will always be better, safer opportunities.",90,27,1756804353,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1n6enfv/meta_psa_protect_yourself_from_fake_job_posts/
