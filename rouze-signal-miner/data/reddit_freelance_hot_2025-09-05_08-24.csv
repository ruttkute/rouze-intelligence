1n7sk5o,freelance,Trying to get out of hellish contract,"I need advice on how to get out of a hellish contract.  I was booked to write a 7-asset project. Had the  kick-off meeting the brief was barely there so had to help define . But when I went to actually start, it turned out the project wasn’t ready. The problem? Delivery timelines had already been promised to the client, so the project leads were scrambling to get things prepared — while my writing time was already ticking down.  On top of that, I was asked to help get the project ready (which wasn’t in scope). Since then, it’s all gone downhill.  My timelines have been massively condensed for intricate work, so quality has slipped and now they’re complaining.  The people running this have no clue how long these assets actually take, so they demand 24-hour turnarounds for work that should take a week.  I’ve been working evenings and weekends, and I’ve had enough.  Communication is chaotic — I get pinged by multiple people constantly instead of being allowed to focus.   They overpromised the client, under-delivered, and I’m the one taking the blame. Instead of managing up to the client, they’re pushing down on me.  My contract states that if the brief or delivery dates change, I can revisit my quote. I triggered that clause and gave them two options:  1. Accept my new (inflated) quote — because frankly, I don’t want to continue.   2. Replace me with another copywriter (I even suggested one), though they’d have to negotiate terms separately.    They’ve already paid me most of the budget in instalments, but I’ve worked way more time than agreed, so I don’t feel bad keeping it.  This whole mess is now impacting my other clients, my finances (I had to bring in emergency support out of my own pocket), and my sanity.  The only thing I’m worried about: my contract might not be watertight. It does have a termination clause that says I’ll be paid for work done and will hand over completed work.  Has anyone been through something like this? What’s the best way to cut ties without getting screwed?",5,2,1756937315,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1n7sk5o/trying_to_get_out_of_hellish_contract/
1n7ndi8,freelance,Does Contra actually work for freelancers?,"I just took the Pro account on Contra last week and honestly… it feels like a total joke.  Spent 2 damn days setting up my account, polishing portfolio, all that shit and guess what? There are barely any jobs. Like almost none for UI UX Design.  Meanwhile, every profile I see has $100k+ earnings slapped on it. How? From where? Are they handing out Monopoly money or what? Because the gigs section looks like a desert.  Right now, it feels like a lowkey fraud. They push you to upgrade, show off big flashy numbers, but when you actually join, there’s nothing happening.  Has anyone here actually gotten legit work from Contra? Or is it just another shiny “freelancer platform” that’s more about selling Pro accounts than helping freelancers?

1n706gq,freelance,How to uphold motivation even when things go well?,"When things go well, I earn more than on average for a short-time, I tend to tell myself I can now slack a bit because it went so well. How to keep working optimally regardless of results?   I know that 100% efficiency is not the most sustainable goal, but there is probably a way to mentally reframe the goal to something more productive like if I think about milestones instead of efficiency, doing additional work means getting there faster, not just some number in an infinite process. Or if I don't aim for 100% but for 80% efficiency, it's also easier and I probably get more done than when aiming at 100%",3,5,1756858603,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1n706gq/how_to_uphold_motivation_even_when_things_go_well/
1n5njxb,freelance,My boss tripled my workload but I’m still getting the same pay. How do I ask for a raise?,"I’ve been creating video content for a company for a while now. When we first set up the deal, the expectation was that I’d produce about 30 short videos a month plus 3 story clips. I handle all of the filming, I do most of the editing myself whether it’s on my phone or on my professional camera, and then I upload everything into the company’s drive where it gets posted.  Now my boss has told me he wants 100 videos a month plus 5 story clips. That’s more than three times the original workload, but my pay hasn’t changed at all.  Right now, I’m being paid about $1,500 every two weeks which works out to around $3,000 a month. With the new workload, I believe it’s fair to raise my rate to about $3,000 every week (so basically doubling my current monthly pay and making it match the amount of work being asked of me).  I want to handle this conversation respectfully and professionally. I have a good relationship with my boss and I don’t want to sound like I’m bragging or threatening to walk away. I just need to be clear that if the content output is going to more than triple, the pay has to match that level of work.  For anyone who’s dealt with scope creep or a sudden workload increase, how did you approach asking for higher pay? Should I put everything in writing as a contract and hand it to him, or would you start with a face to face talk and then follow up with paperwork?",40,33,1756730264,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1n5njxb/my_boss_tripled_my_workload_but_im_still_getting/

1mo039j,freelance,What would you do when the client doesn't have a clear request?,"Hi, I'm working as a part-time music producer on Fiverr.  I've got some orders to produce music and doesn't find yet how I should deal with the situation the client doesn't have a clear request.  For example, a client wanted me to make a tropical house song. I asked them to send me some reference songs to make sure what they want. I got the reference songs from them but they say ""I like the songs but need to change something. Please just make somethings like them.""  To make sure what ""something"" means, I asked them some questions like bright or dark, soft or hard, bouncing or stable, any specific sounds they liked in the reference songs. I didn't ask them about any music theory things like chord progressions or scales because I know they are not music professionals.  Although their answer was ""Not sure. Just make a demo and I'll think about it later"". I had a bad feeling that they would ask me to change a lot after I made demos. But I couldn't ask them anything anymore so I made some demos to find out what they want. And it came true...They asked me to make a completely new style. It was when I was a completely beginner there so I accept it to get a review. It was tough though.  So my question is, do you accept an order even if the client doesn't have a clear request yet? Keep it not get started until you can make sure you can do for them? Or do you charge additionally if they would ask you to change a lot?  The tough thing is that most clients don't have any knowledge about my speciality and that's why they place an order on my service. I'm trying to ask some questions to them with easy and not technical words to clarify their requests. I know it's one of the skills as a professional (seller) though, it's hard when the client says just ""make something like this"" and ask me to make a completely new stuff.",19,25,1754975986,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1mo039j/what_would_you_do_when_the_client_doesnt_have_a/

I used to conduct demos through a platform called LeadrPro, and had $900 in my account as earnings. A few months ago, I logged in and saw that the entire balance was gone after a UI change. Since then, I’ve sent 5+ follow-ups via email and still haven’t received a response.  I’m not accusing anyone of anything malicious, things happen in startups, pivots are common, but I think it’s only fair to ask:  Has anyone been paid recently?  Is the company still active?  Has support responded to anyone lately?   I’d be happy to work with them on a resolution, but the silence makes it difficult to stay optimistic. If someone from LeadrPro sees this, I’m open to a conversation.  Appreciate any info. If it’s just me, I’ll take it as a one-off glitch and keep trying.

1luvfie,freelance,Dealing with a client claiming issues that don't exist,"Long story short, I have a client I built a small app for. They have used it for 7 or so years. The previous person left that managed it. Now someone else does. Besides the fact this client calls and emails everyday the big issue is they claim there is a non-existent problem.T  here is a report that is emailed to them every night. They claim it's incorrect. They forwarded me the report and it's clearly incorrect.  I run the code manually to check the report, report is correct. I tell them this and I email them the manually run report.  Well this has gone on now for over a week. Everyday, the report is incorrect. Mean while the other reports that run along side that report are correct and have no issues.  I BCC'd myself on the report to confirm it's working. Sure enough it was. Meaning the file was correct the entire time. Yet they would forward me the same email I was on but with a different file.  Then I added a checksum hash when the file is created on the server. For the non-tech people, it's a fingerprint of the file. To prove it's the same file. The checksum is created when the file is created and then also it's hidden in the email so I can validate the file never changed. Sure enough, I check the file, it's the same every single time. Yet the file they send me is incorrect.   Like not even closely the same file.  I don't know what to do here.   Clearly they are just wasting my time.  I've agreed to support them for the year but there is no signed agreement/contract. There is X amount of hours allocated for issues I didn't create but the issue is, I think they are going to claim this issue isn't from them. But it's not an issue and I can't bill against the agreed upon hours.  I'm more than willing to refund them partially as I've done code updates. If I didn't have to deal with this person, I wouldn't mind staying on. I really struggle with someone intentionally wasting my time. Even if it's a couple minutes a day.  Or do I just deal with them and accept that they suck as a client. I mean, it's known that my app will be replaced after this year.  What would you do?

1lt9fvq,freelance,Software for online teacher and student to keep track of lessons owed?,"I work as an online freelance teacher. In most cases, students buy a package of lessons and then we book the lessons, either at the end of a lesson or using calendly. I currently keep track of the number of lessons I owe them by adding a counter in the events in google calendar. In the cases where they owe me, the counter is negative.  But the students don't have access to this counter. And sometimes there may be subtle misunderstandings about the counter. For instance, a student cancels in the last moment and they aren't aware that I have a 72h cancelling policy (because they haven't read my terms of service) so they think the lesson isn't spent. Or somtimes it's a parent paying, teenagers forget lessons... I can send emails informing of the state of the counter but would look a bit weird.  I'd like to have some kind of portal where I log this, and students can see their lesson saldo, how it's recharged by certain invoices, how it's spent by certain agreed dates, etc. Is there an easy out of the box solution for this that I could install in a lightweight server or using the cloud?  Otherwise I could use a shared google calc sheet for each student, but it feels a bit more hackey solution.",22,24,1751829334,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1lt9fvq/software_for_online_teacher_and_student_to_keep/
1lf5yyo,freelance,I keep missing deadlines — it’s the 5th client now and I feel like I’m ruining everything,"I'm a freelance video editor and I’ve been trying to make this work full-time, but I keep messing things up — and I’m not sure how to break the cycle.  This is now the 5th client where I missed a deadline. Most of them started as small projects (like $100–$200), but the work always expands — feedback turns into full rewrites, or I procrastinate too long, then rush, feel overwhelmed, and eventually miss the deadline entirely.  Latest case: I delivered, then got feedback that completely changed the project. I got distracted, fell behind, and today the client told me that he will look another editor. So now I’ve lost two weeks and the project. No payment. No result. Just exhaustion and regret.  I hate this pattern. It feels like I’m burning bridges one by one, and every time I tell myself ""next time I’ll be better,"" but then… same thing.  I don’t think I’m lazy. When I do work, I can focus for hours and I really care about the quality. But it’s like the pressure builds up, and instead of acting, I freeze. Or waste time on YouTube, telling myself I’ll start soon — until it’s too late.  Has anyone been through this? How do you break out of it? I don’t want to keep sabotaging the few chances I get.

1ld0uvj,freelance,How to keep clients and get referrals,"Many freelancers struggle to keep clients and get referrals. There are four simple rules I adhere to:  1. Always overdeliver. Never promise more than you can do, it's better to promise less and deliver more. 2. Always be honest, never lie, even if you make a mistake. Admit it, that builds trust. 3. Always be on time and never miss a deadline. 4. Communicate early and often and keep clients updated on the project and progress. If they’re asking ""how is the project going?"" you’re already behind.  Once a client is happy with your work and trusts you, they'll likely be happy to refer you to others.

1l9mtf4,freelance,Toxic client or just emotionally unstable?,"I’ve been managing a client for about 5 months now. I built and launched their entire marketing system, lead funnels, ads, content, strategy, everything. The results speak for themselves: 10 move-ins in May alone (they’re in the housing space), and the funnel continues to deliver consistent leads and conversions.  The issue isn’t the results, it’s the relationship.  The client (let’s call him “A”) is reactive, controlling, and cold. From day one, he’s been dry and transactional, but recently his tone has shifted into something more toxic. Some examples:  * He overreacted to a minor blog draft that hadn’t even gone live — literally just a line that mentioned a competitor’s name (a generic word like “Hope”). * He made a passive-aggressive comment like, “Scorecards don’t drive move-ins anyway,” which felt like a direct hit at the strategic framework I’ve built — despite the numbers proving otherwise. * In a meeting earlier this year, he literally slammed the table with his fists when asking a question I had already answered. (That was my first red flag.) * He asks for insights, then gets defensive when I give them, like when I recommended reducing overposting on one of their socials. * He often changes the subject after saying something off — like switching from a tense moment to generic AI questions, almost like a diversion tactic.  And yet… he still approves all content. He hasn’t paused anything. He hasn’t brought anyone else in. He just seems… emotionally disconnected and honestly an a\*\*hole.  I don’t know if he’s:  * Actively looking to replace me, * Slowly backing out * Just operating from a place of ego and poor communication.  We also meet WAAAYYY TOO MUCH, 4 times a month is too much for an already stable account. I’m fully capable of continuing this relationship, but only if I shift into “no-emotion, tight-delivery” mode. No more collaborative energy. Just deliverables and metrics.

1l31z3s,freelance,Freelance Journey’s Mistake: Being Greedy.,"4 months ago i applied for a freelance project for an NGO. I was selected for interview, we went over the project details and later i sent quotation. i asked for 10K usd and through mail negotiation we agreed on 6K.   The project was to recreate all the illustrations for 4 different school subjects from grade 5 to 9. Almost around 40 units for each class. Along with pages templates for each subject.  Long story short, the job duration was 3 months, they had a library of pre existing illustrations i had to puzzle to make the illustration needed, translate and do graphic design work, adapted to the branding style, i had to illustrate many things from scratch, google for hours for non AI generated copyright free images….  It was hell of project and they were happy I managed to finish on time, even before the deadline (rip my neck) and uploaded the files on their drive, as well as my communication with the teachers, creative coordinator was clear and on the point. They were happy.  Although the payment was 2 months delayed due to International restrictions, i got payed eventually.   2 weeks ago, I received a proposal for another project with another project manager within the same NGO.  I had to ask him about the details and he said he needed a illustration consultant and he needs six illustrations over the four month period of the project .   he asked for my quote now my only mistake is I researched the project who’s funding it, found its a generous grant. I quoted 1,600 USD flat fee.  And since I’m a consultant, not a freelancer typically I will have to start from conceptualizing from zero and with my fair judgement. Not given a task to do 1 2 3  I emailed him a follow up email yesterday, and today he emailed me that they selected another candidate. They are still impressed with my work and they will keep coordinating for future project and blah blah blah blah..   I guess what is hurting less is they approached me, not i applied to them again. And my mistake ig is sending a flat fee rate without further asking for details about the illustrations themselves. Instead i researched the market standards price.  And what hurts is perhaps not getting any more proposals from them. Especially when their projects are expanding.

1l1vhwi,freelance,I filed a legal claim after being unpaid for work I completed — and I’m done staying silent about how women in creative roles are treated.,"This is a bit of a long story, but here’s the short version:  I’m a creative professional (designer, strategist, art director) with 20+ years of experience. I was hired (by a friend of 25 years) last year by a mid-size company in the film and television production industry to manage their internal and external art direction, branding and design. I delivered a ton of new assets … including photography, rate cards, catalog layouts, spec sheets, logos— the calibre of work that makes a business look polished and credible. It took almost a year to put all this together from scratch.   Everything was submitted. Everything was used.  But when I submitted my final invoice, the owner refused to pay unless I handed over all my working files. Files that were never part of the agreement, never needed … until after they replaced me with a new agency. They wanted everything so they could pass it on. No license agreement. No compensation. No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.  Instead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense.   I filed a Small Claims Court case.  And I want to say this — because I know a lot of women here will understand:  We get praised when we’re agreeable, fast, and “team players.” But when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries — suddenly we’re “hard to work with.”  Well, I’ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent.   I’m not sharing this for revenge. I’m sharing it because:  1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team.   2) We’re expected to deliver premium work — and in return get ghosted or gaslit.  3) We’re supposed to be “grateful” instead of being compensated.  No more.  Document your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to. Silence is what they’re counting on. And it’s the one thing I’m no longer offering.  I’m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same — you take this as your sign.  You and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for — or paid for.   ….  Quick Update June 13th:  Client still refused to pay … ( deflection then silence — even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign.   As mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.  Today, an ad came up in my feed. They’re running Facebook ads using my work — creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project.   They tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they’re commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It’s not right.   Again, If you’re doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don’t assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system — it exists for this exact reason.",275,112,1748902750,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1l1vhwi/i_filed_a_legal_claim_after_being_unpaid_for_work/

In my experience and what I've asked others, this happens before they sign the contract or have agreed on a price. It's also non negotiable unless I do small contracts. I lost a big client when I refused to do this.   Is there any way around this?

1l21ruj,freelance,client cancels bc of health what to do?,"Had a new client with a lot of mutual enthusiasm to work together. After a rather quick start and a lot of dates booked on my calendar, this person started canceling left and right. The work needs to be in person, it’s coaching and speaking prep, so we have to actually meet. Can’t just do our respective parts alone.   I think they kept about 3 of over a dozen scheduled appointments, and had to cancel the rest due to a variety of health issues. It sounded serious, like they went to the ER on more than one occasion. Had to switch meds and canceled because they were having a bad reaction. Every time, some similar issue. The problem is they’d cancel usually same day. Sometimes less than an hour before the planned time. I hate to be a dick and reprimand someone who’s in the ER but man was it frustrating. Naturally I say no to other clients and meetings so this was just not viable. Then they’d feel better and send me dates to reschedule. No apology about the last minute cancels or acknowledgment that this is unusual behavior.  Has this ever happened to anyone? I don’t think this person was lying but  I also felt really shitty about asking for a kill fee. Until they did this the 7th or 8th time then I felt like an idiot for even planning them into my schedule.   Really don’t know how to approach this one. Just ghost them and stop replying?

While some of this is the standard ""I didn't read the subreddit rules and don't understand that this isn't /r/forhire, so please hire me/work on my project"" stuff I am used to dealing with, I suspect a lot of the increase is due to AI. I have removed dozens of posts that are some iteration of ""go to Gumroad and buy this ebook/PDF/guide that will help you freelance"" (one even stated that its purpose was to help you create ebooks with AI to sell to freelancers).

1kmj4wt,freelance,"Need advice – manager putting pressure on me to “use initiative” but giving no guidance, now expecting free labour + major scope creep","Hey I could really use some advice.  I’m currently doing a freelance videography job (contracted) and had a meeting today with one of the people managing me (she is a freelance ‘social media producer’ and has started at the same time as me). She’s barely been involved so far — doesn’t give clear guidance, hasn’t been very available — and today she basically told me to “use my initiative” for capturing B-roll on an upcoming shoot. Then she *implied* I didn’t use initiative last time.  Here’s the thing: last time, I wasn’t told *anything* about what the shoot would involve. I was just told the location address,I had no schedule, no idea what would be happening, and even arrived not knowing there was an event happening in the space. The interviewee was two hours late, so while I was waiting, I grabbed extra B-roll of people setting up for the event while I waitng — stuff that ended up being used and *even praised by her manager*, who asked for it to be used more (I unfortunately don’t have much more). So… yeah, I did use my initiative. I just wasn’t given the information to plan more than that. Also to add she won't be at the next shoot (which i thought wasnt great considering she has been in contact with the people we are interviewing and created the questions (barely, as i will have to add to them)  Now put a cheery on top of all of this, the original contract was to deliver **three 90-second videos**. That’s it. But now they’ve said they also want **three 7- 10 minute videos** *in addition* to the short ones — all from the same footage. The thing is, the first shoot was never planned for that — I wasn’t told it would go on a website, I didn’t shoot enough B-roll to cover a 7-minute cut properly, and it honestly wasn’t filmed with that in mind at all.  When I raised that concern, the manager just casually said, “Oh don’t worry about B-roll, just use what you have, or don’t add it — people can just listen to the interview.” I’m sorry, but we all know how bad that looks. And I’m now stressed because I *know* that’s not going to fly once the drafts go out and 100 people give feedback saying it needs to be tighter, more dynamic, etc.  She also vaguely asked if I “need a budget,” and that she has spoked to her manager to raise extending my pay with the rest of the team - but heavily in a low-key way insinuated that I should/could consider doing it for free. (its a small activist org that focuses on world social issues)  I’m trying to be flexible, but I feel like I’m being set up to fail and then blamed for it.  Im also new to videography/freelance. So this job is knocking my confidence even lower than what it was before, which I did not know was possible.   Any advice? Has anyone else dealt with this kind of vague managing and shifting expectations? What’s the best way to push back professionally and protect myself?",25,24,1747239049,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1kmj4wt/need_advice_manager_putting_pressure_on_me_to_use/
1kmgsrx,freelance,"Hey folks, looking for some advice as a newbie.","So i recently started a freelance web design business. To take the leap, I put myself out there and mentioned to someone who has a small business I do custom website templates. Were instagram friends and she said she was in the middle of a rebrand and could do with a website, hence my very out of character offer to do a free site to build up my portfolio (as freelancing rewards the brave right?!)   Anyway, what was supposed to be a quick turnaround (10days) has turned into a soul drainer. I have realised through working with her, she doesn't really have a brand, more a hobby and vibes (i mean not even a returns policy for her products, a strategy, a customer profile, a brand voice/tone, brand philosophy, product images as awaiting new labels, nothing really except products and a new logo). Plus she Keeps changing the launch date. So I've literally given her alot of structure, direction and dope ass copy too (that doesn't match her non existent brand tone but I'm a visionary and concept creator and see the potential etc).  My annoyance is, she's emailing and whatsapping me EVERYDAY at all times from 1am to 11pm and also keeps asking for my input and ideas on things outside of website design.   She also asked if I can manage the site as she wants nothing to do with it😒 and wants monthly updates on the website but can't say of what?! I do design only and general updates like layout change, page additions etc but really prefer to make custom templates for self led business owners who just don't have time or the creativity to make one but can spare 10mins to upload their latest blog, it's just Squarespace not Web Dev lol.   I have learned alot in this short work about my own future direction in this industry and updated my own customer profile lol.   Anyway I don't know if I'm just ranting at this point lol sorry folks.

I mentioned a flat fee for releasing the website, but that we may charge hourly for changes beyond that or for back-n-forth work that may be extraneous to a minimum-viable product (MVP).  After we'd gone through several iterations of the site (all good learning experiences for us, maybe 25 hours of work all around, and not a complicated site), when the time came to release, she put it off and requested more changes, this time more deletions of previous work or re-wording or moving things around... it just began to feel like more busywork and delays than any sort of progress.  When I then mentioned payment for the release, an expected deadline, a site design for MVP, and hourly pay for re-doing things, she got upset and acted as if we never agreed to any payment, and is now threatening to not continue with the site and a sister site that we spent some hours on investigating and poking around with.  Unfortunately there's no formal written agreement, the business isn't registered yet, all we have is a brand website and our text/email communications (no meeting/call recordings since we've been easy-going and she's been super-nice). Frankly I don't understand the aggressive turn-around, and she spent more money with the previous people whose work she didn't like even though they didn't drop the ball on anything that I saw.  **Endpoint:** So, now that I'm back in the fray, what do you suggest for this client? My partner will try to salve things over through phone (since my comments were in email), but it appears the client misread and forgot about a lot of things discussed, and her personality didn't come off earlier as being anything like a deadbeat. She makes a lot of money and our charges are far lower than the standard.  Also any advice for new clients, I'm looking into getting contracts and a ramp-up workflow going (especially with project management), but it looks like it's gonna take a lot of time and possibly mistakes to get a smooth process from discussion to payment.",22,31,1745954877,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1kawm1j/first_client_mad_about_having_to_pay_for_work/

I’m a generalist, so i do everything in the pipeline imaginable, including animating, producing, copywriting, marketing, etc etc etc. I’m often a one-man band. I think that would be juicy for a company to have, but am wary competing against other candidates that are specialists in a specific field. I’m also finding that company’s like having someone who’s acclimated to corporate culture.   Maybe this is the wrong sub to ask this, because we are freelancers - we enjoy the money and the flexibility. But i’d like to have a backup plan and a bi-weekly paycheck.",12,8,1745712879,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1k8r3p7/how_to_leverage_freelance_experience_to_going/
1k744jv,freelance,I’m being paid $7K/month as a contractor… but I’m also funding my client’s growth out of pocket. Is this normal?,"I’m a full-time creative contractor working for a private sports academy. My official rate is $7,000/month. Sounds decent on paper, but here’s where it gets messy.  I’m responsible for everything related to media: video production, editing, photography, graphic design, 3D assets, social media, and even web management. I’ve also been running the academy’s Instagram account solo — everything you see on that page is my work.  In the past 90 days, the page has pulled in over 747,000 views and reached nearly 76,000 accounts. That’s with under 4K followers. Only about 10% of the growth was from ads — the rest was all organic, performance-driven content.  Here’s the catch: 	•	All ad spend is coming out of my own paycheck 	•	I also cover gear purchases, like SD cards, batteries, camera accessories 	•	I pay for the entire Adobe Creative Cloud suite myself 	•	There’s no media budget — just me, eating the cost to keep things growing  So while I get $7K/month on paper, I’m actually taking home closer to $6,200–$6,600/month, after I subsidize their content pipeline.  To make it worse, leadership literally said I should “gain leverage over us” by driving more growth — basically telling me I need to pay my own way to prove I deserve the pay I’m already getting.  I’m doing the work of a full in-house team (creative director + strategist + content producer + ad buyer), while also footing the bill for results they’re taking to investors.  Am I being taken advantage of here, or is this just part of the freelance hustle?

1k5uvfb,freelance,probably lost my main client 😭,"so after many month of burning the candle at both ends, working a 9-5 time and freelancing in my spare time, it's happened - I took on too much extra work and ballsed up a freelance job by rushing it to hit the deadline. Its market research and though the report I provided was acceptable, it turns out there were a couple of pretty obvious points missed which I simply overlooked, which obviously they're unhappy about.  Looking highly likely that I've lost them. My time management and chronic tiredness issues are after all not their problem. Why should they take the risk?  Thing is this company had become my main client, up to 60%-70% of freelance income some months, and they've been reliable and steady. I even allowed myself the fantasy that I could potentially use it a springboard to quite day-job and go f/t freelance.

1k2huq9,freelance,Awkward client situation,"Hey All, I have a bizarre client situation that I am looking for help navigating.  First off, I am a brand designer with years of experience, an MFA, and a good history working with clients, but this is throwing me for a loop.  I started working with this client about 3 weeks ago and met her through another client of mine.  My new client is looking for help creating her new brand and website ahead of her book launch (she just got a book deal and hasn’t written the book yet).  I created a proposal for the project and she opted for the lesser package.   We started the project with a brand questionnaire, then I had her make a Pinterest board to zero in on her likes and dislikes and then two weeks ago we had our second meeting where I showed her my initial illustration work and font options for logo.  I prefaced all of this by explaining that it was all very preliminary, just to see what she gravitates to and to see if I nailed the style and tone of the work.  We had a great call, she liked what I did, gave me some great feedback, and I went ahead with the edits.    Fast forward a week.  I wrote her to see if she had thought any more about the typeface she wanted me to further explore for her logo and she confirmed her choice.  The next day, I get a request for someone to review the deck I sent to my client, assuming it is a friend and she wants a second opinion on something, I give access.  The following day I get an email from my client with the woman I shared the deck with copied.  The email says that she consulted with her “brand marketing manager” for additional feedback.  My thought at this point is, if you have a brand marketing manager, why I am doing this work, but also, I’m happy to take additional feedback if it makes sense.   I read this woman’s feedback and some is valid, and what me and my client already discussed, but the rest of it is lacking a lot of context.  She goes so far as to suggest 5 typefaces (which look terrible together) for the website, which makes me think she thinks the work in the deck is final.  She also gives specific HEX codes for a palette.  When it comes to stuff like this, I am not going to get my feathers ruffled if my client wants to implement these suggestions, however, I am confused about my role.  I went ahead and used chat GPT to help polish an annoyed email into something more friendly, and sent it over last night.  It essentially says, thanks for the feedback, why don’t we all hop on a call and create a game plan for how to proceed because this is a lot of feedback.  They agreed and we are meeting next week.  Now for my question- should I write to my client separately and ask what her  how “brand marketing manager” is going to be involved going forward vs. how she would like me to be involved?  Or should I address this on the call with both of them?  Typically, I wouldn’t involve the brand marketing manager in the convo, but the fact that my client cc’d her makes me think I should include her.  That said, addressing this on the call could feel confrontational.    Also any thoughts on this agenda for the call?   AGENDA 1) Review proposal (I’ve already overworked this, and I want the new woman to see what I’ve agreed to)  2) Explain the context for my last deck and show the progress I’ve made  3) Discuss feedback from email and how it may or may not fit with the work I’m doing (e.g. I’ve never seen 5 different fonts used on a website where it looks polished, and I don’t think that approach is right for a “clean and simple” site which was the request)  4) Create a game plan for the edits and next steps  Lastly, I am dying to know if this woman has experience in design and brand development and if so, what it is, but that feels like a snarky question to ask on the call and Google is bringing anything up in my research on her.  That said, she could also be a designer or she could be a friend with a fancy title.  It’s hard to say.

1jwsd4z,freelance,Is it rude to walk away from an event happening in a week?,"I was “hired” to sketch at an event for a luxury brand that’s happening in a week, but I never signed a contract. I agreed to do it through a client working with the brand - not because I needed the money (I have a stable full-time job), but because I thought it would be a fun experience.  Unfortunately, working with the client has become increasingly frustrating. We originally agreed on just two sample sketches, which I provided, but they continued to push for more. When I set boundaries and reminded them that I usually charge for those, they accused me of “causing tension"", but they would pay me for the new sketches as a ""gesture of good faith.""  Since then, their communication has been messy—long, contradictory emails that feel manipulative and gaslighty. For example, they’ll send references of what the brand supposedly wants, then completely change direction. When I explain that I can’t deliver full-color, high-detail sketches in 5–7 minutes, they dismiss it by saying their other artists can. That alone makes me feel like they’re misrepresenting what I can actually realistically deliver to the brand, which sets me up to fail at the actual event.  I tried backing out a few weeks ago, but they responded with guilt-tripping language like “it’s our responsibility to follow through for the client.” Again—no contract was ever signed. And to be honest, their tone in emails has been increasingly condescending. I’ve stayed professional, but checking my inbox makes me anxious and angry to the point that I’ve been avoiding it entirely.  I’d love to be honest and tell them how poorly they’ve treated me—but more than anything, I just want to be done with it. So… would it be rude to back out now a week before the event?

1jqg9kw,freelance,Exchange rate fluctuations are just heartbreaking as a freelancer,"I'm not here to ask for advice or anything, I just need somewhere to vent with people who hopefully might be in the same boat.  I am a YT video editor living in the UK and I'm incredibly lucky that the type of work I do is consistent and generally pays the same month-month (I work on a basis of X projects a week, so my income fluctuates depending on how many weeks in the month, but I bill and get paid monthly, so it feels like a ""real"" job).  I love my job, I truly do. But the one part of it that is always just so heartbreaking is working in dollars. I don't really get a say in this. The channels I work with are American, they pay me in dollars and even though I could attempt to request that I get paid in GBP and not USD, I imagine that conversation would go ""No.""  But what that means is that no matter if I am doing the same work week to week, month to month, year to year, my income is completely at the mercy of the world currency exchange. And it's so heartbreaking to watch my hard work count for less over time as the world goes more and more to shit.   I worked it out today that as of today, 1200 USD = 911 GBP  In 2024 it was 949 GBP  In 2023 it was 962 GBP  In 2022 it was more aligned with how it is now, so I KNOW it fluctuates. I get it, and I get this is the job I chose and I knew the pros and cons, one of them being at the mercy of the exchange rate, when I sought out this sort of career path.   It just doesn't get any easier when in the financial year that just ended, I made 38565 USD, which if all exchanged today, would amount to 29282 GBP (the real number is different ofc because I get paid monthly and the rate changes over time) whereas if I had made the exact same amount of money at the end of the last financial year, it would have been 30482 GBP.   Again, I KNOW it doesn't work exactly like that, because I don't get paid in one lump sum. But the lump I get in my throat when I see that 1200 GBP difference year to year, which amounts to HALF of my earnings last month, just doesn't go away. For some people, maybe 1200 a year isn't that much, but for me it's basically two vacations worth, that I am losing to .... basically nothingness. I'm not losing it to taxes, I'm not losing it to working less, I'm not losing it to vacations, I'm losing it just because.   With the news yesterday regarding the tariffs in the USA and the havoc that I expect it to create on the USD/GBP exchange rate, I just needed a space to scream into. I wish so badly that I could just get paid in my domestic currency, but it's just not ever going to be possible with my line of work.   Thanks for listening guys, and please be kind in the comments, I know I am not starving or close to homelessness or anything like that, I am very fortunate to even make the money that I do, it's just at times like these when the world is in such flux, it can be hard to watch your value dip further and further for reasons completely outside of your control.",1,1,1743680778,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/1jqg9kw/exchange_rate_fluctuations_are_just_heartbreaking/

I'm in the film/tv industry and have been fortunate to work on some pretty cool stuff, but most of that type of work comes by fluke and I've no idea how to source work by myself.   I see some people that are able to be social and friendly with the producers and people who could hire them again, and as much as I get along with people this has never worked out for me. I see other people are good friends with, and work for, those who seem to constantly have a steady flow of working coming in, and I don't have that either.  An industry friend told me it's about ""staying on peoples radar"" and even suggested a way to make friends could be to reach out and ask questions about kit (apparently that gets people chatting). I've never known how to use that advice and I'm stuck in this loop of trying to think of ways to stay in peoples minds whilst everything keeps mving around me.

1jlymnc,freelance,Managing Multiple B2B Contracts While Delegating Work – Any Advice?,"Hi, I’m a UX/UI Designer and lately, I’ve seen a rise in B2B contracts where companies want you to act like a full-time employee but still classify you as self-employed. I know this is a misclassification, but after being laid off, it’s my only option right now with the proposals I have.  I’m thinking of taking on two full-time B2B contracts and outsourcing some of the work. The issue is that these companies expect me to be full-time for meetings and tasks, even though I know it’s not right. My idea is to be “the face” and have help in the background.  Has anyone managed to juggle multiple B2B contracts or worked with an associate without raising concerns? I know delegating is fine, but if I tell them, they’ll probably drop me. I plan to check in on my associate’s work and keep things smooth without the clients knowing.

This client became my anchor client last year.   My contract started as ad-hoc hourly and then moved into a project based contract for 2x 3-month sprints.   The end date of the contract was end November last year and my mistake was not getting them to sign a renewal before the year was up. I “did them a favor” by saying that we could pick up in January again because I would be away for most of December anyway. There was still a lot to do to support them.   Of course, January came and went. They didn’t return my calls or emails. Eventually, February came around and the owner finally called me back. He pretended like nothing had happened. And then casually said they don’t need me right now. I tried to understand and put it down to them running out of funds, but he runs other businesses too and is otherwise extremely busy.   TLDR is; he never did recontract. And I lost my anchor client and really struggling financially trying to find more work.

Then they wanted me to pull data for them for outreach. Ok great, did that, still training.   Then they wanted me to do calls side by side to show them in more detail. Ok did that.   Then now they are saying ""We actually just want you to make the calls.""  This is obviously NOT what I agreed to, but I need the money so I'm doing it.  **Second Client:**  Book a meeting for them, great. The day before hand they want to bring on a second person to the call, but that person can't make the appointment date so they want me to call and reschedule. This person doesn't NEED to be on the meeting, my client just wants them there last minute.   I explained that to my client that rescheduling last minute will reduce appointment rates, but they still told me to do it.      Naturally, the prospect didn't take it too kindly and saw it as unprofessional and they lost that opportunity.  Had another prospect who said they would be interested and booked the time, but simply asked for the client to send them specific information first. They emailed my client directly about this. They didn't send the email, so naturally, that customer also didn't take the meeting.

1ivqb9w,freelance,My Small Claims Court Experience,"Collecting the rewards for our work is very gratifying. When we don't get paid, it's demoralizing, extremely frustrating, and can leave you feeling powerless. Let me preface this by saying that I've been freelancing for almost 20 years. I have had more clients than I can count - large and small, from all over the country and a few in other countries. I don't use contracts. My clients tend to have fast turnarounds and business is done on a virtual handshake. This was never a problem until three years ago.   I worked on a project for a client that I had known and worked with for several years. At one point the project manager was a friend outside of work. I completed a weeks worth of work for them. They were happy with it, and it was invoiced. Long story short, they never paid and eventually they ghosted me. Through the grapevine I heard that things went south for the company. After months of back and forth communication, promises of payment that were never fulfilled, I notified them that I would be filing a small claims suit if I didn't receive payment within a week. That time came and went, plus some, so I filed the suit. It was cheap and easy - $25 bucks and about 30 minutes of my time. It took a while to get my first court date - about six months. They didn't appear, so I won the case by default. They had 30 days to pay the judgment, but never did. Next I filed for a garnishment of wages hearing in order to get paid (another $25 filing fee).   For the garnishment of wages hearing the defendant is supposed to report all of their financials - cash in hand, monthly business costs, etc. The court will decide based on that if they should pay outright, or come to an agreement on a monthly payment amount. Again the defendant was a no show. I couldn't get them served and they didn't accept the service via registered mail. The judge finally allowed me serve anyone from the company for another garnishment of wages hearing. He waived the fees this time. I was able to get those papers served by a sheriff, but again the defendant didn't show. At the next hearing the judge was reluctant, but said he would issue a warrant of arrest for the president of the company. I forwarded those documents to the president, and I had a check in my hand within four days.  This whole process took three years and about $300.00. The defendant had to pay all court fees plus interest on the original judgement. The court calculated and applied the interest to the judgement at each hearing.   Was it worth it? Absolutely. I would do it again in a heartbeat. One, it was a good life experience. I had to navigate through something on my own, that was completely foreign to me. It was frustrating in that they were unresponsive. They were playing the long game hoping that I would just give up. And that's the key to the process. Be patient. Expect that the process will take a while.
