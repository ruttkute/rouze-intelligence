t69nl3,HireaWriter,Tips and rules for posting in r/HireAWriter. A guide to get the most out of this subreddit.,"Regardless of your role on this subreddit, I highly advise everyone to read the whole guide at least once to get up to date. Since reddit is a difficult website to moderate job offers on, we have a lot of rules, community involvement, bot enforcement and norms on this subreddit. Reading this guide will maximize your chances of success and will minimize your frustration with removed posts.    **Some tips to get a good response for your job offer (for employers)**-  Job tiers are as follows:  ***Entry level Work*** *= 7c/w or $15/h (Employers cannot ask for portfolios from writers at this pay rate, as these opportunites are truly for fresh writers).*  ***General Work*** *= 12c/w or $20/h (Most jobs fall here)*  ***Advanced Work*** *= 17c/w+ or or $25/h+ (take note of the +, as this is the bare minimum to qualify). White Papers fall under this category with a minimum rate of $1 per word.*    * Minimum job offer rate is 7 cents/word. If you pay by project, have it adjusted to roughly that equivalent. Remember this is the bare minimum, and if you want to attract writers for a certain niche and want to build a long term relationship, the higher the rate the better (in that case 10cents/word and above is recommended). * If you are hiring for advanced level jobs (which require more difficulty or qualified writers), you are to pay at least 15 cents per word or more. You can use the ""Hiring \[Advanced\]"" flair in your title. * Jobs which require more research than usual like scripts, creative work like world-building and fiction writing, and SEO related work, require that you pay by hour, not per word. Contact the mods for clarification if you are unsure where your job stands. Employers must also approximate how many hours a project is going to take, whether it's a one time thing or a recurring project like a monthly retainer. In case of the latter, also specify how long you plan to hire for. * If you want to reserve the right to refuse the work, you have to mention that in the post. Treat it as a contract, otherwise a writer's complaint for non payment over rejected work, will have you banned. As that means you have requested full work without paying, exploiting the writer. On that note, you are not allowed to fish for spec work on this forum, and all requested work should be compensated for with a deposit before starting (if below standard then you can refuse the final payment). It is crucial that you clearly state this in the post (your deposit amount can be below the 7 cents per word rule, and is to be immediately transferred before any work is to begin). Don't break Rule 4. An idea on how to word your post related to this is: ***""Once a writer is accepted, I will transfer a ($) deposit, and transfer the remaining amount upon satisfactory completion of the work. I reserve the right to refuse the final work and cancel your remaining payment if the work is below our standard. I will do my best to communicate what the desired standard of work is, and will give you at least one try to fix the work based on actionable feedback"".*** * You cannot ask for ""native"" English speakers in the requirements section. That creates a bias and is archaic considering how international the language is. Judge people on their sample and portfolios not on where they were born. This is an international forum, where people from everywhere deserve a fair shot. * **When requesting samples from writers, specifically ask for samples in text form (e.g a doc file), never in PDFs. This will make it easier for you to do a plagiarism check. Always verify that the writer is not just sending you google top hits for whatever topic you want them to write on.** Even a cursory google search from a few random lines will answer that question for you.  Scammers usually take a google top hit on the topic, convert it to a pdf, then a image and then a pdf again which makes plagiarism checks difficult. Be wary of pdfs! * Use the appropriate ""Hiring"" post flair. This is mandatory (all posts not following this rule will be removed without warning). * Employers are encouraged to use the ""Employer"" user flair if they are regulars on this subreddit. * Be very clear on the starting pay and payment methods (Paypal preferred). Offers without a clear pay would be removed. If you are willing to negotiate or haven't decided on an exact pay, state that, but then give a range of values you would agree to. **Unpaid work is not allowed here (Ad revenue share is considered unpaid work, as well as any revenue sharing agreement based on views).** * List the job requirements (if any). * Give an idea on how much work you are expecting. For example, two articles per week, or if its a one time job. * Our subreddit maintains a massive ban list of scammers. But they can still direct message you. To make sure they are not on the list (and save your time) ask all shortlisted applicants to make a comment on your job posting. It could be anything vague like ""I'm interested"". If you can see the comment, the user is not banned. Writers with the ""Verified Writer"" flair, means they have previously completed at least 1 job on this subreddit successfully and were manually approved by a mod. This is a very small group (around 50, as of Aug 2021). Upon successful completion of the assigned work, hired writers may request you to message the mods on their behalf to grant them this flair. If you were satisfied with them, you should help them as that improves the writing community on this subreddit. * Once you have found the writers you need. Add the ""Closed Hiring"" flair, so new willing writers aren't misled, and you save yourself some spam. * If you want to post the same job offer again, make sure you delete your old one first. Only 1 repost allowed every one week. A higher frequency would be considered spamming, and could lead to a ban. Using multiple accounts for the same services is also not allowed! If you have multiple job offers which require separate posts, contact the mods to bypass the flooding rule. * ***Academic Work offers are allowed***. As long as they follow all other rules. This rule is not permanent, and will be reviewed again at a future date, but for now its tolerated. For future reference eventually all academic work offers will be forwarded to [](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireanAcademicWriter), so if you are in this business its best to follow that subreddit too, as the future of such job offers is there.  **For the writers-**  * [Before anything read this article on what entry level means on this sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/comments/pryxvp/writer_guide_what_entry_level_means_on/) * Minimum ask rate is 7 cents/word. Don't undersell yourself below this, even as a relatively new writer. * Use the ""Hire Me"" flare. This is mandatory (all posts not following this rule will be removed without warning). * Writers are encouraged to use the ""Writer"" flair. There is also a special ""Verified Writer"" flair, which can only be granted through mods. To earn it you need to complete at least one job and your employer has to contact the mods with the following: a short review of how they are satisfied with your work, your username, and a link to the original ""hire me"" or ""hiring"" post (if the original post is deleted, a screenshot can also work). The approval is done manually so can take up to 1 week to take effect and you wont get a message when it is approved but periodically checking this sub (under ""Community Options"") will let you know when its up. If you have previously completed work on this subreddit but cant find the initial post, you can contact the mods to help you dig it out. Even then we still need a message from your employer to verify you. * Ask for a very clear upfront payment, or state your word rate, or your hourly rate. * One post per week at most. Remove the older one, if it is a repost. Using multiple accounts for the same services is also not allowed (tracing it back to you is easier than you think)! This is a bannable offence! **Let me state this even clearer, you can only have 1 post up on this subreddit at any given time.** * Content mills are not allowed! Mills masquerading as normal writer accounts will be banned forever, and your website will be made public information. This subreddit does not exist to promote your business. * If the OP for the job offer failed to deliver on the payment. [Report them immediately](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/HireaWriter), so we can [ban them](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/comments/9obcux/meta_scam_and_review_thread_2/) (bans are permanent and sitewide thanks to our membership in the [Universal Scammer List](https://universalscammerlist.com/)). * Go to  *  for reviews and to post experiences. All hiring posts have an automatic link created for the  *  page for the user who posted. * List your writing achievements, and links to your published work, if you decide to post your credentials. * If you are an unproven writer, don't worry, just look for some jobs on this subreddit. You wont get a lot of benefit from posting, unless you can offer something unique or have a lot of experience. Remember its easier to get a job from replying to a ""hiring post"", than waiting for someone to reply to your ""hire me post"". If you still want to post your credentials, you can use the weekly writers sticky thread. * Be as descriptive as possible, as employers would be using the search engine to find you. So mention if you are a ghostwriter, specialize in gaming (if so, which genre), etc. You benefit the most by keeping your post as long as possible, with a lot of key words. According to our polls, most jobs are actually given by employers directly contacting you via your hire me post, not the other way around. * Never give a sample of more than **150 words** (only scammers will ask for more than that). Report those who ask for more. * Be very careful when an employer asks for your ID, as it is a common scamming tactic. Or asks you to download some software, asks you to pay for anything, or anything out of the ordinary. Remember this is still Reddit, and employers cannot be verified by us. When in doubt, contact us, but honestly trust your gut. * [This website](https://www.the-efa.org/rates/) is a useful reference to see how to charge per word. * [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/comments/4hvtzm/for_hire_seo_copywriter_and_content_strategist/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/comments/9w0lgw/hire_me_seo_content_on_tech_business_lifestyle/) is an example of good writer post. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/comments/hhhn9t/meta_some_writergiggettingtips_i_have_learned/) is a helpful post to help you land a client. * Make sure you post some online accessible portfolio page showcasing your writing. If you dont have a portfolio, don't post as it will be removed. Instead post on the weekly Hire Me stickied post. * Academic work related hire me posts are no longer allowed on the main page. For that use the weekly Hire Me stickied post to share your services.  **General Notes**  1. Low karma (below 10) and young accounts (less than 3 days old) cant post. This will block many of the throwaway spam accounts. This rule can be circumvented by contacting the mods for manual approval, remember that we only care about blocking spam, and if you are caught unfairly due to simply being a young account, we will approve the post. This rule does not apply to any HIRING posts as they get approved as is. 2. Posts below 200 characters get automatically removed, as they are considered low effort, and in no way can anyone cram all the important information in that limit. 3. Posts with 3+ reports get removed automatically (but will still be manually reviewed at the end of the day, to make sure its not a false positive). This gives the power to remove posts to the community, so make sure you report rule breaking posts. 4. No more than 1 post per week, this will be automatically enforced. Since this is giving those posters an unfair advantage over everyone else. 5. **DO NOT UNDERCUT RATES DURING NEGOTIATIONS!** Always stick to 7c/w at least. You do not make yourself more competitive by going below it. Only thing you achieve is lowering the negotiation power of everyone in the sub. 6. All writers are suggested to post a generic message on the Hiring posts like ""I'm interested"". Just to prove to the employer that you are not on the ban list, once they shortlist you. 7. Make sure you mention one of the following in your post : ""$"", ""€"" ""cents"", ""euro"", ""¢"", ""£"". For example: ""we pay $50"". This applies to writers and employers. Not mentioning a rate will have the post removed as it breaks subreddit rules on a compulsory rate (even if it can be negotiated later). The subreddit does not support any other currencies, so even if you are paying in a different currency (do mention that in the post), convert it to the equivalent $/€/£ value and make sure it meets the minimum criteria of your required hiring level. You can pay/receive money in Bitcoin/Crypto, but again it needs to be clearly stated, and you must mention the amount in the equivalent $/€/£ conversion at the time of the post. 8. **For employers and writers the minimum wage here is 7 cents per word**. 9. [I would suggest everyone to read our policy towards AI driven work and AI detector tools here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/comments/15tjiks/a_note_on_the_use_of_ai_detection_tools_and_best/)    **Niche Work (if you still have questions, read this)**  1. Editing work: If you are an editor, you can post Hire Me work on this subreddit, and employers can also hire from here. For Hire Me posts the minimum rate is 1 cent/word. For Hiring, 1 cent/word is Entry Level, 1.5 cent/word is General, 2+ cent/word is Advanced. For Writers and Employers, it is critical that you use the word ""Editor"" or ""Editing"" in the title, to avoid being flagged as a normal writing gig. 2. Translation work: Exact same rules as Editing. Use ""Translation"" or ""Translator"" in the title 3. Ghost writing: Ghost writers who create Hire Me posts cannot share their previous work due to legal reasons. Hence from now on they are exempt from posting an online portfolio PROVIDED they contact the mods prior to posting and disclose us some proof (would be the same material they would share with potential clients, we just want 1 short sample or a link). The post will then be manually approved, hence it might take 1-2 days for the whole process.  The user on his own request can also be granted the new ""Ghost Writer"" flair, which would make the process faster in the future and skip the verification, allowing them to make future posts without any mod intervention. If Ghost writers, want to publicly link an online portfolio (of work they can legally share), they do not need to ask mod permission. This rule is only for Ghost Writers who cannot legally share any work at all, and are forced to create a Hire Me post without any portfolio. 4. Copywriting: Since this type of work is very short writing (20-50 words), and due to the online nature of it, has a lot of edits and optimizing involved (with keywords) to get a CTR. These type of jobs are encouraged to post a fixed rate for the project, but should still be at or above 7c/w. Ideally, they need to be paid an hourly rate, for a fixed number of hours. 5. Erotic/NSFW writing: This is completely allowed, and you do not need to ask mod permission to post Hire Me/Hiring posts related to this. Just mark the post as NSFW. 6. Game/Movie script writing (and other salaried writing work): Salaried work is not subject to word count and more dependent on final deliverables. Hence word counts are not established for these jobs. They are instead paid by hour, as per project duration. Ideally  state ""Salaried"" in the title, which makes it clearer to everyone reading the post.

1n5qxfx,HireaWriter,[Hire Me] Looking for Clients to make more $$$$ - Are You Next?,"EDIT - 02/09/2025:  Closed. 13 of you reached out. Said no to 7 of them. I am sorry.   The rest of the 6, I will review and get back once I am done working on this webinar funnel.  x-x-x-x  I'm a so-called ""experienced"" copywriter.   Have written copy in the healthcare (dental, aesthetics, vet and a bit of law copy) &amp; FMCG niche.  I am very blunt and candid.  If your copy is shit, I will tell you, and then offer to fix it (or completely revise it for you, if that's what YOU need to make it work - have done it many times, and trust me, I know shit copy that just won't convert from miles away).  If your marketing ideas simply won't produce the results you are looking for, I will tell you that straight to your face.  I am here to help you make more money.  If that's what you're interested, shoot me a PM.  If this isn't the kind of partnership you are looking for, you can skip this post.  Otherwise keep reading...  x-x-x-x-x  Listen, fellow redditor.  I have a few open slots. I can take 2 long-term clients or 3 short term projects.  The clients I work with have an average deal size of at-least $1000-1500 or more.  I have generated a lot of revenue for the clients I have worked with.  From Marketing companies to Coaches, Consultants, and more.  I charge on a project by project basis. I should be charging a lot more than what I currently do, but that's on me. More goodies for you, I guess.  My favorite part of what I do is to working on evergreen assets that continue to generate revenue month after month.  \- Webinars   \- Podcasts   \- Ads   \- Funnels   \- Email Sequences and more.  Now back to you.  Are you stuck? Do you want help? Do you NEED help? Are you embarrassed and want to turn things around for your business? I won't judge. I can help.  Tell me what industry you are in, what you're struggling with, and I will see if I can help.  I have taken on short-term projects worth $200, to long-term projects upwards of $5000/pm and more.  So it really is up-to what you need, whether I can help you (sometimes, I get clients who have great copy already... and need help on other areas like strategy or advice), and more importantly, if you'll be a chill guy/gal to work with. I am picky.  I won't waste your time, so I hope you don't waste my time either.  Adding a link, cause rules:   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmIMrWrMzv1qCV-G\_IZh60WlTth9WY81JHGRkQRWacA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmIMrWrMzv1qCV-G_IZh60WlTth9WY81JHGRkQRWacA/edit?usp=sharing)  Context: This was from like 2020???, when I was a wee copy lad. I wrote all the core copy, and launched this project with my employer back then. Ended up generating like... $1.5 million. We later shut it down cause of reduced interest for virtual mastermind-style workshops, after lockdowns eased up.  But the reception was pretty good. Even led to a nationwide partnership with a billion dollar company.   That was my favorite part.  Anyways... talk to me for more recent copy that might be more relevant for your usecase.  PM for my email.  Thanks,   Sajid  P.S: I hope to see you on the other side.",0,1,1756738628,https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/comments/1n5qxfx/hire_me_looking_for_clients_to_make_more_are_you/
1n51q93,HireaWriter,[For Hire] Blunt (but constructive) Beta Reading,"I have my bachelor’s degree in English and recently finished an editorial internship at a small press. I'm aiming to someday be a full-fledged editor.  My area of expertise is speculative fiction—an umbrella that includes fantasy, science fiction, horror, magical realism, and all things fantastical.  **Other areas of interest/knowledge:**  Sapphic/Lesbian Fiction (of any spice level)  YA  Video Game/Visual Novel Scripts  I have a solid handle on the tropes of romance and romantasy. I'm happy to beta low spice m/f and m/m stories, but if what you have is high spice or erotica, I am not a good fit for you. I'm not your target audience, and there are things your reader might love that will simply baffle me.  I can help with plot holes, word choice, pacing, flow, dialogue, and characterization/character development. My beta reading tends to be more extensive than most, and can border on developmental editing advice. You’ll receive line notes, as well as a beta report.  A warning; I can be a little blunt, but never mean. I don’t sugarcoat critique or sandwich it between compliments to make it easier to swallow—but I’m not going to torch your work with a flamethrower either. I also make sure to give praise where praise is due!  I’ve seen concerns on various writing subreddits about paid beta readers not actually reading the work and instead running it through AI. I share those fears about AI’s impact on both human creativity and the job market for writers and editors. I promise I won’t feed your work to the demon.  After having some success with this sort of work, I have modestly raised my rates.  My current rate is **0.0015** cents per word, or **$1.50 per thousand words**.  Drop me a DM to inquire about my current beta schedule.

1n22xh9,HireaWriter,What to do when client claims work as AI ?,"I work as a ghostwriter and I recently approached a client looking for someone to help him with a self-help book.   We exchanged texts, requirements, sample work and quotes on Reddit DMs. After that we decided that I would write a page according to the client's instructions and notes, and if it was what the client was looking for, we would sign a contract.   I woke up at 4 am in the morning (after having slept at 1 am) and spent TWO hours working on a single page (500 words), editing it TWICE to provide quality work and then submitted it to the client...   Spoiler: The client claimed it to be AI and refused the contract.   This is a genuine question to all the other writers and clients out there. WHAT are we supposed to do to prove that our content is NOT AI written?    EDIT: I see writers asking me to name the client but I have reasons not to:   I am worried about legal repercussions AND reputation. Ghost writers outing their clients is bad for business because even if the client wasn't good, the fact of the matter is that I did out the client's information and that is a big NO in the industry because it means that I would also be willing to defame legitimate clients.   It could also seem as me taking my frustration out on an innocent person just because I was rejected for a job. Especially if the client claims that they didn't want to work with me because my writing wasn't up to their standards. Then the blame falls solely on me. This is a rabbit hole I can't go under.

My name is Gabriel Foxx Martinez, and I am a seasoned freelance writer with experience in various mediums, such as webcomics, video games, and films. Though, by heart, I am a scriptwriter, I do offer services as a ghostwriter, proofreader, worldbuilder, and editor.      I started my writing career as an assistant script analyst at a production company, analyzing speculative scripts and grading them on their viability for bidding agencies. Sounds like a dream, right? I thought so, too. Only it's not. Think of it as a typical 9-to-5 office job requiring much reading and paperwork. Lots and lots of paperwork. Despite that, it gave me valuable insight into what goes into creating a work of art on the silver screen, and it gave me the courage to become a freelancer in my spare time. To this day, I still work at the same company, but I someday aspire to retire from the tie and focus on my true passion--writing compelling and thought-provoking stories.         **Genre Experience:**     As a generalist writer, I am well-versed in most genres, understanding familiar tropes and clichés, which I use to articulate a narrative that the target audience can enjoy. Of the many genres, **romance**, **drama**, and **horror** are where my writing skills are at their highest, and I'm confident I can provide some insight into them. Here is a list of genres and subgenres I've worked on in the past:     * Horror * Thriller * Action/Adventure * Fantasy * Romance * Boys' Love (yaoi) * Girls' Love (yuri) * Drama * Slice-of-life * Mystery  **Writing Commissions:**     I am a fast and efficient writer, translating to a quick **turnaround time**. On average, I can turn in a polished **4,000-word** assignment within seven days (**16,000 words a month**). Due to the complicated nature of writing, my rates vary based on the necessary format and medium. Writing a visual novel requires a different perspective and discipline from narrative design (video game writing).      Now, here is the question you're asking yourself, ""How much do you charge?"" Good question! I charge $0.05 per word!      If you want to learn more, feel free to check out my website.      Here is a list of writing commissions I offer:     * Screenwriting &amp; Teleplay writing * Visual Novel Writing * Webcomic &amp; Comic Book Writing * Narrative Design * Worldbuilding * Proofreading &amp; Editing * Beta Reading and Narrative Analytics (script coverage) * Story Outlining  **Contact:**     If you believe I fit your project, contact me through email or Discord anytime.

1mode7z,HireaWriter,"[Hire Me]Freelance writer,screenwriter,ghostwriter,creative developer,novelist looking to create compelling stories of adventures,comedies and dramas.(Pay Rate:0.25/word)","My name is Ronald Payne and I want to be your next freelance writer. I'm a passionate film watcher and can quote most of the classics. I typically watch movies in the action adventure, sci-fi, fantasy and thriller genres but appreciate most of the big franchises. Serial storytelling is a favorite nut to crack while enjoying developing core essential characters that can flow through multiple installments. I don't discriminate on taste if you have a different genre in mind.  I can research and develop for the story that you want me to tell. I can ghostwrite and format creative pitches into pilots. I can write full length feature film screenplays (for less than wga script rates)(unless you want it very quickly). I can write fictional or non-fictional narrative podcasts or teleplays or web shows.  PAYMENT My screenplay rate can be negotiable but is always done in double payments, with one at the beginning as a retainer and one when it is finished and satisfactory. If you don't want to pay a retainer Im not working for you. Im calling off work for the months and it's going to take alot to preplan, start and finish the project so that retainer shows me you can afford to put money into creative story development. It also shows me that you are serious. I will provide a plan of approach and how long it should take and keep a week by week updates from then on.  SCHEDULING/UPDATES I will give daily updates and keep communication clear while keeping you as informed as possible where I am in the process. DISCLAIMER: When it comes to creative development and writing a script don't expect it to happen overnight at a high quality. In story development it is essential to be cautious and patient. I assure you that if you're looking at story development with patience,eventually you will see the story you want as a long term investment than it was worthwhile in the end.  Need a Quick Screenplay In A Month? If you really need a script in a short time you can hire me but don't expect the quality to be extraordinary. 1.The minimum window that I will crunch and push out a script for a two hour long screenplay is 2-3 months. 2. If you need a rough feature length screenplay under an hour long or close to it in a month time. The price is $1650.  Short Stories I can provide short stories in a short amount of time. You can look in the flash fiction section below for examples of what you might be getting. My pay rate for those are 0.10/a word.  SIDE NOTE: Most things you probably love were delayed or rewritten more than you'd like to think. I believe that's a big part of why they succeeded.  Fun Fact: Toy Story, the original finished script story for the movie, based off the critically acclaimed short ""Tin Toy"" had to get thrown out.  The most important lesson I've learned these past years is that good writing takes time and great writing takes even longer. My focus is to find a price for the both of us AND a time window that is close to what you want but also is realistic to me. We can work together to find a way somehow to give our project its legs.  (work samples below.)  Looking forward to hearing from any of you and taking on the beast of creativity. Sincerely, Ronald Payne.

I’m a bit of a perfectionist, so I’ll happily make any tweaks you need until it feels just right.  Again, the cost is $0.07 per word, which I think is a fair price for solid, high-quality work.

1mgd7ui,HireaWriter,"[Hire Me] I Will Write Your Deepest Desires - Romantasy, Satire, Femdom, Bi! Let’s do this shit! (Wait, not literal shit!)","I have come here today to offer my services. These services being? Well, some say the pen is mightier than the sword. But I say, writing takes great responsibility. You need someone knowledgeable and experienced with a delicate hand. A hand that will use just the right amount of pressure when handling sensitive things.    And what do I write, you ask? I could say just about anything and that would be true. But let’s be a little more specific here. I can write your deepest, darkest desires (some exclusions may apply).    And what makes me qualified? I have spent an intensive 8 weeks traversing the deepest, darkest, dirtiest corners of the internet (Reddit in particular). I saw everything from the wholesome to the bizarre, and I tempered my mind in the filth you gooners wallow in when you think no one is watching. I assure you, I do not judge (some exclusions may apply). I am prepared to offer a discreet, professional experience discussing what you like so I can put it on the page.    My experience, you ask? Well, I can’t give you all my work as I like to keep this account separate from my true identity. But I can offer up fan favorites such as “[Gooning for 10-15 Hours](https://www.wattpad.com/1564115385?utm_source=ios&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_content=share_reading&amp;wp_page=reading&amp;wp_uname=Madame_Monroe)” and “[Offering for the Dragoness](https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/s/01IQivRbMC).” As you can tell, I am fully prepared to give your story a satirical spin to give you plausible deniability in case anyone were to find it. “Oh, this? This is just satire, I’m not actually into that freaky stuff.”    Further, I take great pleasure in weaving erotic tales into epic adventures. Your horny protagonist can face many trials and tribulations that can include, but are not limited to: centaurs, dragons, lizard people, bird people, fish people, snake people, and werewolves. Do note though, I do not write icky things like bestiality (I reserve the right to judge you if you ask) these must be fictional beings that are mostly human. Furries and scalies are acceptable. Dragons are ok if they are anthro or shapeshift into a human-like being before the big scene.    You know, I am a little scared putting this out there. A friend of mine told me not to do it, they said they had to quit commission work after being asked to write a scene where a skunk sprays a lady, and it all went downhill from there. But, I’d like to think I’m a little braver than them, or at least not too traumatized yet to make this attempt at financial independence.    So, tell me! What is your deepest desire? It’s like that one song, “I’m the only one who’ll love your sins” (some exclusions may apply).    *Pricing: 0.07$/word*   Exclusions: - You must be 18+ as well as the characters you  want me to write.   - As previously stated, no animals.  - No extreme violence. Ok, fine, how about some hard spanking? I could do that. Just nothing too crazy, ok? I have my mental health to look after.   - I reserve the right to reject any scenes with non-con. Dub-con can be discussed depending on the situation.   - Scat? Uh, I don’t know, dude. Might have to charge an extra fee for that sort of thing.     My Specialties: - Femdom! I love writing a strong, independent woman.   - Male submission! I’ll make that cute little guy tremble in fear and pleasure!  - Men loving men! I may not be male myself, but I am familiar with the anatomical structure of the male anatomy. I know just which buttons to press, if you get my drift.   - Fantasy! Sci-fi! Porn with plot! Let’s just get freaky with it, ok? What’s the point in all these mechanical movements, jerking around and such? Let’s give these characters some stakes! Let’s say if the malesub cannot please the big strong dragon lady/man/other, he’ll get eaten! And not in the fun way.   - Other kinks: hey, I’m pretty open minded as long as it’s not illegal! Feel free to reach out with questions, I’ve been wanting to explore different niches.    My pen awaits your command! (Not in a kinky way, ok, I’m a respectable erotica writer! No sexting!)",1,3,1754206123,https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/comments/1mgd7ui/hire_me_i_will_write_your_deepest_desires/

1me1coj,HireaWriter,"[Hire Me]Freelance writer,screenwriter,ghostwriter,creative developer,novelist looking to create compelling stories of adventures,comedies and dramas.(Pay Rate:0.25/word)","My name is Ronald Payne and I want to be your next freelance writer. I'm a passionate film watcher and can quote most of the classics. I typically watch movies in the action adventure, sci-fi, fantasy and thriller genres but appreciate most of the big franchises. Serial storytelling is a favorite nut to crack while enjoying developing core essential characters that can flow through multiple installments. I don't discriminate on taste if you have a different genre in mind.  I can research and develop for the story that you want me to tell. I can ghostwrite and format creative pitches into pilots. I can write full length feature film screenplays (for less than wga script rates)(unless you want it very quickly). I can write fictional or non-fictional narrative podcasts or teleplays or web shows.  PAYMENT My screenplay rate can be negotiable but is always done in double payments, with one at the beginning as a retainer and one when it is finished and satisfactory. If you don't want to pay a retainer Im not working for you. Im calling off work for the months and it's going to take alot to preplan, start and finish the project so that retainer shows me you can afford to put money into creative story development. It also shows me that you are serious. I will provide a plan of approach and how long it should take and keep a week by week updates from then on.  SCHEDULING/UPDATES I will give daily updates and keep communication clear while keeping you as informed as possible where I am in the process. DISCLAIMER: When it comes to creative development and writing a script don't expect it to happen overnight at a high quality. In story development it is essential to be cautious and patient. I assure you that if you're looking at story development with patience,eventually you will see the story you want as a long term investment than it was worthwhile in the end.  Need a Quick Screenplay In A Month? If you really need a script in a short time you can hire me but don't expect the quality to be extraordinary. 1.The minimum window that I will crunch and push out a script for a two hour long screenplay is 2-3 months. 2. If you need a rough feature length screenplay under an hour long or close to it in a month time. The price is $1650.  Short Stories I can provide short stories in a short amount of time. You can look in the flash fiction section below for examples of what you might be getting. My pay rate for those are 0.10/a word.  SIDE NOTE: Most things you probably love were delayed or rewritten more than you'd like to think. I believe that's a big part of why they succeeded.  Fun Fact: Toy Story, the original finished script story for the movie, based off the critically acclaimed short ""Tin Toy"" had to get thrown out.  The most important lesson I've learned these past years is that good writing takes time and great writing takes even longer. My focus is to find a price for the both of us AND a time window that is close to what you want but also is realistic to me. We can work together to find a way somehow to give our project its legs.  (work samples below.)  Looking forward to hearing from any of you and taking on the beast of creativity. Sincerely, Ronald Payne.

1mbkz9m,HireaWriter,"[For Hire] Professional creative writer for hire, 9 years of experience, $0.10 per word","Hi, I'm a fiction writer with 9 years of experience, and I'm looking for work. Here are some of the things I can do for you:  Ghostwriting services. That includes blog articles, social media posts, emails, fictional works of any length, and narrative memoirs. I'll write whatever you need without including my name, and the rights to the resulting work will remain with you.  Erotica and smut. I'll write an erotic story of any length, according to your preferences, with no judgement whatsoever. I have a strict confidentiality policy with respect to my clients.  Fanfiction. If there's a scenario you've always imagined happening in a series you like, but you weren't able to write it down, you can leave that part of the process to me. Let's give your imagination a written form.  If you have some other writing-related request that isn't listed here, tell me about it and I'll see what I can do.  Whether you have a barely formed idea or a detailed outline, I'll help you craft it into a story that fulfills your vision.  My standard rate is $0.10 per word, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price for each of my clients, depending on the scope of the project and other factors. Everyone deserves a personalized approach, no?  Payments are mainly done through Paypal, but Cashapp is also a viable option.

1mbfbye,HireaWriter,[For Hire] Nsfw writer for hire,"Your humble servant in the art of literary temptation. I specialize in crafting the sort of stories that would make angels cover their eyes and demons take notes. The kind that leaves readers questioning their moral compass while reaching for a cold glass of water.  I've made it my personal mission to explore every shadowed corner of human desire, every whispered fantasy that polite society pretends doesn't exist. Inflation? Child's play. Tentacles? How *quaint*. Gore that would make Edgar Allan Poe blanche? Now we're getting somewhere *interesting.*  **Services Offered with Sinful Excellence:**  -Roleplay sessions that blur the line between fiction and confession *($30 per hour; quality worth your soul, but I'll settle for PayPal)*  -Commission work that transforms your darkest musings into literary masterpieces *($70 per 1,000 words; the devil himself would pay double, but I'm feeling generous)*  -Personalized corruption of innocent tropes into something far more... entertaining  Whatever delicious depravity you believe might make me flee in horror has likely already graced my keyboard more than once. The writhing poetry of tentacles, the sweet transgression of femboys caught between worlds? Yuri that burns like hellfire, Yaoi that would make saints blush, and depths so dark that even I occasionally pause to admire my own audacity. *Bring me your most creative sins.*  **The Only Lines I Won't Cross:** Nothing involving minors. Even demons have standards. No scat content.  Think of me as your literary Mephistopheles, ready to help you craft deals with desire itself. After all, the best sins are the ones wrapped in beautiful prose, don't you think?  Contact me when you're ready to let your inhibitions... *slip away.*  https://adarshthapa.journoportfolio.com/  Yours in delightful Damnation, Akagi High  Discord: SFK_15-cinders",1,1,1753707133,https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/comments/1mbfbye/for_hire_nsfw_writer_for_hire/
