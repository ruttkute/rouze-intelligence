## Variant B
Hi! Loved the brief — here’s how I’d handle it fast without cutting corners.

**Approach**
• 2–3 quick concepts (invite/modern by default)
• 1 round of refinements
• Final PNG + source if needed

**Tiny clarifiers**
- Do you have brand assets (logo/fonts/colors)?
- What size and format do you need (e.g., Instagram post 1080x1080, PNG)?
- What mood/style should it follow (clean modern, playful, corporate, pastel, brutalist, gothic)?

Happy to start right away and keep updates short + visual. (https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignJobs/comments/1my8u85/for_hire_graphic_designer_brandingvisual_identity/)
