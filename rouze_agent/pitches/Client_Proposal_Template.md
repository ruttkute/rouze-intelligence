CLIENT PROPOSAL TEMPLATE

Subject Line Options:
- Market intelligence your competitors don't have
- Fresh insights from sources [Company] probably hasn't checked
- 5-day market research vs the usual 3-month wait

Proposal Body:

Hi [Client Name],

Saw your project about [specific need they mentioned]. Most market research pulls from the same sources everyone else uses - industry reports, surveys, published studies. By the time you get those insights, so does everyone else.

I take a different approach. Instead of waiting for processed reports, I analyze what your customers are actually saying in places like Reddit discussions, product reviews, job posting trends, and forum conversations. Raw signals that reveal market movements before they show up in traditional research.

Recent example: Helped a [similar company type] spot a competitor vulnerability through review pattern analysis. They moved fast on that intelligence and captured a $380K market opportunity.

For your [specific challenge], here's what I'd deliver:

Week 1 Analysis:
- Fresh signal collection from [2-3 relevant sources for their industry]
- Pattern recognition across customer conversations and competitor mentions
- Business implications with specific next steps

Deliverable: Executive brief with actionable recommendations (not just data dumps)
Timeline: 5 business days
Investment: $[300-800 based on project scope]

This isn't generic market research. You'll get insights specific to your situation that your competitors can't access through standard channels.

Want to see a sample of this type of analysis applied to [their industry]?

Best,
Arune
