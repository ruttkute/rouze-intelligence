### VIDEO INTRODUCTION SCRIPT (60 seconds)
```
"Hi, I'm [Name] from Rouze Intelligence.

While most companies make decisions based on 6-month-old industry reports that everyone has access to, I analyze what customers are actually saying right now on Reddit, in reviews, and across social platforms.

This gives you insights your competitors simply don't have.

For example, I recently helped an e-commerce client identify a sustainability trend 3 months before it hit mainstream reports, leading to $380K in new revenue.

I deliver executive-ready intelligence in 5-7 days, not months.

If you're ready to discover what signals your market is sending that your competitors are missing, let's talk."

### Initial Response Template

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your interest in strategic intelligence analysis.

I'd love to help you uncover the market signals your competitors are missing.

To provide the most valuable insights, I have a few quick questions:

1. What specific business decision is this analysis supporting?
2. Who are your main competitors or market benchmarks?
3. What timeline do you need this for your decision-making?

My methodology involves analyzing fresh, unfiltered signals from social platforms, reviews, and forums - not the same processed reports everyone else uses.

Recent client results include $380K revenue opportunities and $500K cost savings through early signal detection.

Looking forward to creating strategic value for your business.
