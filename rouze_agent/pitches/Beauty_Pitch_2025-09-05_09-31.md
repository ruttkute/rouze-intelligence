Subject: Fast beauty insights from real buyers & communities (48h)

Hi — I combine **community buzz** (Reddit) with **buyer truth** (recent Amazon reviews) to spot what to say and fix next.

What I’m seeing now: https, work, writing drive conversation, while reviews flag top frictions like packaging/fragrance.

I’ll deliver a 2-page **Signal Snapshot** in 48h for **$75**:
- scrape 2–3 relevant subs + 1–2 of your SKUs’ reviews
- distill themes & friction drivers
- give you “so what / now what” actions (copy, creative, quick fixes)

Sample brief generated today: Rouze_Beauty_Insight_Brief_2025-09-05_09-31.md
If useful, reply “GO” and I’ll start today.

— Arune (Rouze)
