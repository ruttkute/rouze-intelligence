Professional Title:
Raw Signal Intelligence | Custom Market Research | 5-Day Delivery

Profile Overview:
Most market research comes from the same recycled sources everyone else uses. I dig into the places where your customers actually talk - social platforms, review sites, job boards, forums - and extract insights that traditional reports miss entirely.

Recent project results:
- Technology startup: Found $380K revenue opportunity by analyzing discussion patterns competitors overlooked
- E-commerce client: Identified emerging trend 3 months before industry publications caught on  
- SaaS company: Discovered feature gaps through customer complaint analysis that shaped their roadmap

The difference: While others wait for quarterly reports, I analyze what people are saying right now. You get intelligence that's fresh, specific to your market, and unavailable through standard research channels.

Delivery timeline: 5-7 business days for most projects
Format: Executive-ready briefs with specific recommendations
Investment: Fixed-price projects $300-1000 depending on scope
