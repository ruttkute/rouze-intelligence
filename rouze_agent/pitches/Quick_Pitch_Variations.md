# QUICK PITCH VARIATIONS

## 30-Second Elevator Pitch
"I help companies spot market opportunities by analyzing conversations their competitors ignore - social platforms, reviews, forums. Instead of waiting months for industry reports, you get fresh intelligence in 5 days."

## LinkedIn Connection Message
"Hi [Name] - noticed your work at [Company]. I specialize in extracting market intelligence from sources most research firms overlook. Recent project helped a [similar company] discover $380K opportunity through competitor review analysis. Worth a quick conversation?"

## Cold Email Opening
"Quick question - when you need market intelligence for strategic decisions, where do you typically look? Most sources everyone uses are 3-6 months behind what's actually happening in customer conversations."

## Discovery Call Opener
"Tell me about the last time you needed market research. How long did it take, what did it cost, and did you feel like you got insights your competitors couldn't also access?"

## Objection Responses
**"This sounds expensive"**
"Compared to what? Traditional research firms charge $10K+ and take months. One good insight from fresh signals typically pays for the entire project."

**"We have internal research capabilities"**
"Internal teams are great for analyzing your own data. I focus on external signals your team probably doesn't monitor - competitor mentions, industry forum discussions, job market trends. Different sources, different insights."

**"How do I know this will be actionable?"**
"Fair question. My reports focus on 'what does this mean for your business' rather than just presenting data. Every insight includes specific next steps you can implement."
