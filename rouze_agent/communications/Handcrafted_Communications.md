   ## Discovery Call Script (Artisanal Approach)
   
   "Before we begin any analysis, I want to understand your specific challenge deeply. 
   
   Unlike automated research services, I hand-select every signal source based on your unique situation. Think of it like a curator selecting pieces for a gallery - each source is chosen deliberately for what it can reveal about your market.
   
   Tell me:
   - What specific decision keeps you up at night?
   - What would success look like in your ideal scenario?  
   - What have other research approaches missed about your market?
   - How do you prefer to receive strategic intelligence for decision-making?
   
   Based on your answers, I'll design a completely custom intelligence approach - no templates, no one-size-fits-all methodology."
