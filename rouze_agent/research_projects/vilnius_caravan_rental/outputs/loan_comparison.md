## NORWEGIAN BANKS ANALYSIS

### Critical Finding: Cross-Border Restrictions

All major Norwegian banks have severe restrictions on financing non-Norwegian business operations:

| Bank | Lithuanian Business Eligible? | Status |
|------|-------------------------------|--------|
| DNB | NO | Strictly Norwegian/Nordic assets only |
| Nordea | NO | Business operations must be in Norway |
| Sparebank1 | UNLIKELY | Case-by-case, but strongly Norwegian-focused |
| Santander Norway | UNLIKELY | Primarily Norwegian portfolio |

**Why Norwegian financing fails for your case:**
1. Your business operates in Lithuania (not Norway)
2. Collateral (caravans) located in Lithuania (not accepted)
3. Revenue generated in Lithuania (doesn't meet Norwegian bank requirements)
4. Norwegian banks prioritize Norwegian business risk only

### Alternative: Norwegian Personal Loan (if applicable)

**IF you maintain Norwegian employment income:**

Norwegian banks offer personal loans based on salary:
- Available amount: Up to 500,000 NOK (~47,000 EUR)
- Interest rate: 5.8% APR (better than Lithuanian rate)
- Term: 60 months
- Monthly payment: 905 EUR
- Total interest: 4,300 EUR

**Requirements:**
- Active employment contract in Norway
- 12+ months employment history
- Norwegian bank account
- Norwegian tax residency (or residency visa)

**Consideration:** Personal loan creates personal liability (not business liability). Business remains 100% at personal risk.

**If this applies to you:** Consider as supplemental financing alongside Lithuanian business loan.

| Processing Days | 3-5 | 5-7 | 5-10 | 14+ (unlikely approval) |

| Your Collateral Accepted | ✓ (caravans) | ✓ (land) | ✗ | ✗ |
| Recommendation | **BEST CHOICE** | Alternative | Supplemental only | Not viable |

## FINANCIAL PROJECTION: PAYBACK TIMELINE

**Loan: 50K EUR, 6.5% APR (SEB), 60-month term**

Monthly payment: 912 EUR
Annual debt service: 10,944 EUR

### Break-Even Analysis (Hybrid Strategy — 7,761 EUR revenue/caravan/year)

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Conservative (6 caravans, 70% occupancy)**
- Annual revenue: 6 × 7,761 × 0.70 = 32,596 EUR
- Minus debt service: 32,596 - 10,944 = 21,652 EUR annual profit
- Payback period: 50,000 ÷ 21,652 = **2.3 years**
- Cumulative profit year 3: 21,652 × 3 = 64,956 EUR

**Scenario 2: Moderate (8 caravans, 75% occupancy)**
- Annual revenue: 8 × 7,761 × 0.75 = 46,566 EUR
- Minus debt service: 46,566 - 10,944 = 35,622 EUR annual profit
- Payback period: 50,000 ÷ 35,622 = **1.4 years**
- Cumulative profit year 2: 35,622 × 2 = 71,244 EUR

**Scenario 3: Optimistic (10 caravans, 80% occupancy, premium positioning)**
- Annual revenue: 10 × 8,500 × 0.80 = 68,000 EUR
- Minus debt service: 68,000 - 10,944 = 57,056 EUR annual profit
- Payback period: 50,000 ÷ 57,056 = **0.9 years (11 months)**
- Cumulative profit year 2: 57,056 × 2 = 114,112 EUR

## RECOMMENDATION

**Finance in Lithuania — SEB Equipment Loan**

**Reasoning:**
1. Fastest deployment (3-5 days vs 2-3 weeks Norwegian process)
2. Accepts your collateral (caravans + Vilnius land)
3. Best rate-to-risk ratio for your business model
4. Specialized for equipment rental financing
5. Zero early repayment penalties (scale without refinancing penalties)
6. Clear business legitimacy (Lithuanian UAB registration provides legal foundation)

**Action Steps:**
1. Register UAB (2-3 days, online at valdo.lt)
2. Contact SEB Business Department in Vilnius
3. Prepare: Equipment appraisal, business plan, land deed copy
4. Target funding: Within 2 weeks

**Alternative Supplemental Strategy:**
- If you maintain Norwegian employment income, apply for Norwegian personal loan concurrently
- Max 47K EUR available, 5.8% rate
- Use for initial operating capital (not equipment purchase)
- Provides additional runway without overdependence on single lender
