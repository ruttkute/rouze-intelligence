## SCENARIO-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### If Pursuing Aggressive Growth (Fastest Payback)

**Strategy:** Premium Corporate Events (4 caravans, 48 EUR/night)
- Payback: 24 months
- Annual profit: 25,128 EUR
- Key success factor: Sales capability for corporate bookings

**Challenges:**
- Requires active sales/marketing for corporate deals
- Lower booking volume (42% occupancy) = higher monthly variance
- Seasonal corporate events (Q4 peak)

**Mitigation:**
- Hybrid approach: 3 corporate + 3 budget tourist = balanced portfolio
- Contract with event agencies for guaranteed bookings
- Target team-building market (post-pandemic boom)

### If Pursuing Balanced Safety (Hybrid Model)

**Strategy:** Mixed positioning (6 caravans, blend of all segments)
- Payback: 27.6 months (2.3 years)
- Annual profit: 21,652 EUR
- Key success factor: Operational efficiency

**Advantages:**
- Diversified revenue (60% tourists / 25% monthly / 15% corporate)
- Reduced seasonal variance
- Lower sales overhead (tourists self-booking)
- More resilient to market fluctuations

**Implementation:**
- Start with 3 caravans (15K investment from 50K loan)
- Scale to 6 by month 6
- Reach 10 by year 2 (with reinvested profits)

### If Pursuing Conservative Approach (Low Risk)

**Strategy:** Minimal deployment (3 caravans, prove model first)
- Payback: 69.2 months (5.8 years)
- Annual profit: 7,212 EUR
- Key success factor: Patience, incremental growth

**Advantages:**
- Lowest operational complexity
- Minimal margin for error
- Easy to scale after proof-of-concept

**Disadvantage:**
- Long debt payoff timeline
- Underutilizes available 50K investment
- Leaves capital unutilized

**Recommendation:** Use conservative approach for FIRST caravan only (8K), prove model in 3-6 months, then scale aggressively.

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: How Changes Impact Payback

### Variable: Occupancy Rate (holding 6 caravans, 31.50 EUR rate)

| Occupancy | Annual Profit | Payback Months |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| 50% | 10,200 EUR | 49.0 |
| 60% | 15,900 EUR | 31.8 |
| **68%** | **21,652 EUR** | **27.6** |
| 75% | 25,200 EUR | 23.8 |
| 80% | 28,500 EUR | 21.0 |

**Insight:** Each 5% occupancy increase saves 4-6 months payback. Focus on maximizing occupancy through marketing/positioning.

### Variable: Daily Rate (holding 6 caravans, 68% occupancy)

| Daily Rate | Annual Profit | Payback Months |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| 28 EUR | 19,800 EUR | 30.3 |
| 30 EUR | 21,000 EUR | 28.6 |
| **31.50 EUR** | **21,652 EUR** | **27.6** |
| 35 EUR | 24,300 EUR | 24.6 |
| 40 EUR | 27,600 EUR | 21.7 |

**Insight:** Each 2 EUR/day rate increase saves 1.5-2 months payback. Premium positioning justified.

### Variable: Number of Caravans (holding 31.50 EUR rate, 68% occupancy)

| # Caravans | Annual Profit | Payback Months |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| 3 | 10,000 EUR | 60.0 |
| 4 | 14,652 EUR | 40.8 |
| 5 | 18,176 EUR | 33.0 |
| **6** | **21,652 EUR** | **27.6** |
| 8 | 28,652 EUR | 20.9 |
| 10 | 35,652 EUR | 16.9 |

**Insight:** Scaling from 6 to 10 caravans saves 10.7 months payback. Scale aggressively after year 1 cash generation.

---

## BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS

**How many caravans needed to break even (not make profit)?**

With 31.50 EUR daily rate, 68% occupancy:
- Monthly revenue needed: 912 EUR (to cover loan payment)
- Caravans needed: **1.2 caravans**

**Interpretation:** You break even with just 1-2 caravans. Everything beyond 2 caravans is profit.

**Risk implication:** Very low risk. Even worst-case scenario (1 caravan at 50% occupancy) generates modest positive cash flow.

---

## FINANCIAL ROADMAP

### Year 1: Prove Model
- Deploy: 3 caravans (24K from 50K loan)

- Goal: Reach breakeven on initial 50K investment (~month 27)

### Year 3: Accelerate Growth
- Reinvest profits: 4-5 additional caravans
- Total: 10-11 caravans
- Loan fully paid off
- Expected annual profit: 60,000+ EUR
- Goal: 3x return on initial investment

### Year 4-5: Market Leader Positioning

- Consider second location (Kaunas, Klaipėda)
- Annual revenue: 150,000-250,000 EUR

## ASSUMPTIONS & RISK FACTORS

**Positive Assumptions (could improve payback):**
- No major competition entry (market undersupplied currently)
- Tourism recovery continues post-2025

**Negative Assumptions (could worsen payback):**
- Occupancy drops below 60% (macro economic downturn)
- Pricing pressure (competition enters market)
- Maintenance costs exceed 18% estimate
- Regulatory changes (local zoning, rental restrictions)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Start small, prove model before aggressive scaling
- Maintain cash reserves for seasonal variance
- Diversify guest mix (don't over-depend on one segment)
- Continuously optimize operational efficiency

---

## CONCLUSION

**Recommended Strategy:** Hybrid Mixed Model (6 caravans)

**Timeline to Debt-Free Status:** 27.6 months (2.3 years)

**Cumulative Profit Year 3:** 64,956 EUR (130% return on 50K investment)

**Risk Assessment:** LOW

**Confidence Level:** Moderate-High (based on market research showing underserved market + validated demand signals)
