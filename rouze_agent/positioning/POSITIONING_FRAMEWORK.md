# ROUZE POSITIONING FRAMEWORK
*Never compete on price. Always compete on speed, uniqueness, and strategic advantage.*

## CORE POSITIONING PILLARS

### 1. THE ENEMY
**Who we're positioned AGAINST:**

- Generic business intelligence tools (data without insight)
- Reactive decision-making (responding to competitors vs leading market)

**Enemy Messaging:**
"While traditional research firms spend 3-6 months analyzing last quarter's data, your competitors are acting on THIS WEEK's customer signals."

## MESSAGING HIERARCHY

### Level 1: Hook (Attention)
Fear-based or opportunity-based one-liner that creates urgency.

**Examples:**
- "Your competitors found the adverse event 6 months before you"
- "The feature your customers are begging for? Your competitor shipped it yesterday"
- "The viral product you're buying at $14? It was $8 two months ago"

### Level 2: Enemy (Context)
Define what you're NOT and why the status quo fails.

**Examples:**
- "Traditional pharmacovigilance lags 6-9 months behind reality"
- "Product roadmaps built on surveys lose to roadmaps built on signal analysis"
- "By the time Best Seller rank shows viral products, margins are gone"

### Level 3: Unique Mechanism (Differentiation)
What makes Rouze defensibly different from alternatives.

**Examples:**
- "Patient Forum Early Warning System: 180-day lead time"
- "Pain Signal Detection: 450+ data points, statistical validation"
- "Viral Prediction Engine: 82% accuracy, 60-90 day forecast"

### Level 4: Proof (Credibility)
ROI case study, statistical validation, or authority marker.

**Examples:**
- "$500K regulatory cost avoidance documented"
- "23% churn reduction, $340K revenue retention"
- "58% margin vs 22% industry average"

### Level 5: Next Step (Action)
Clear, low-risk next action with pricing transparency.

**Examples:**
- "90-Day Pilot: $7,500. First alert within 72 hours"
- "30-Day Sprint: $1,200. Feature matrix delivered"
- "Opportunity Report: $500. 5-day turnaround"

## ANTI-PATTERNS (Never Do This)

❌ "We provide raw signal intelligence" (jargon)
❌ "Our methodology uses chi-square testing" (technical, not benefit)
❌ "We're faster and cheaper" (race to bottom)
❌ "We analyze data from multiple sources" (vague, everyone does this)
❌ "Contact us for a quote" (friction, no pricing transparency)
❌ "We serve multiple industries" (generalist = commodity)

✅ "180-day advantage before your competitors act" (specific, urgent)
✅ "$500K regulatory cost avoidance" (clear ROI)
✅ "82% viral prediction accuracy" (proof point)
✅ "Patient Forum Early Warning System" (unique mechanism)
✅ "90-Day Pilot: $7,500" (clear next step, transparent pricing)
✅ "For pharmaceutical companies $50M-$500M revenue" (specific ICP)
