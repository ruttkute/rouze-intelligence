# ROUZE POSITIONING MEMORY PROMPT
*How to Create Premium Intelligence Reports That Justify $500-$5,000 Pricing*

**Last Updated:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** Production Framework - Apply to ALL Verticals

---

## CRITICAL: Read This First

Every Rouze intelligence report MUST follow this positioning framework. Generic "market research" language commoditizes pricing. Strong positioning justifies premium pricing ($500-$5,000+ per report).

**Core Principle:** Raw signals → Real insights → Real revenue

---

## POSITIONING FRAMEWORK (The 7 Essential Elements)

### 1. THE ENEMY (Who We're Positioned AGAINST)

**Purpose:** Create contrast between status quo (slow, expensive, ineffective) and Rouze (fast, affordable, strategic).

**Bad (Generic):**
> "Traditional market research takes longer and costs more."

**Good (Specific Enemy):**
> "Traditional pharmacovigilance relies on FDA MAUDE reports that lag 6-9 months behind reality. By the time adverse events show up in official databases, your competitors have already adjusted safety messaging, updated labels, and protected market position."

**Formula:**


**Vertical-Specific Enemies:**

| Vertical | Enemy | Failure Mode | Consequence |
|----------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Healthcare | FDA MAUDE lag | 6-9 month delay | Competitors act first, regulatory surprises |
| SaaS | Quarterly surveys | 90-180 day feedback loops | Competitors close feature gaps first |
| E-commerce | Best Seller rank analysis | Post-viral market entry | Late entry = 40-80% margin compression |
| Real Estate | MLS historical data | Backward-looking metrics | Miss gentrification 18-24 months early |
| Legal | Quarterly legal research | Slow litigation trend detection | Reactive vs proactive case strategy |

---

### 2. UNIQUE MECHANISM (What Makes Rouze Defensibly Different)

**Purpose:** Name and explain the proprietary methodology that competitors cannot easily replicate.

**Bad (Vague):**
> "We analyze multiple data sources using advanced analytics."

**Good (Specific Mechanism):**
> "Patient Forum Early Warning System: We analyze 10,000+ unfiltered patient discussions monthly to detect adverse event patterns 180 days before FDA MAUDE reporting catches them. Statistical validation (p<0.001) ensures patterns are genuine signals, not noise."

**Formula:**

**Vertical-Specific Mechanisms:**

| Vertical | Mechanism Name | Data Volume | Time Advantage | Validation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Healthcare | Patient Forum Early Warning System | 10,000+ monthly patient signals | 180 days before FDA MAUDE | p<0.001 statistical significance |
| SaaS | Pain Signal Detection Engine | 450+ multi-platform data points | 90-day competitive window | Chi-square tests, 40%+ complaint frequency |
| E-commerce | Viral Prediction Engine | 600+ TikTok/Amazon signals | 60-90 day viral breakout prediction | 82% historical accuracy (200+ products) |
| Real Estate | Gentrification Leading Indicator System | 20+ permit/demographic sources | 18-24 month early detection | Correlation with historical gentrification patterns |
| Legal | Litigation Trend Predictor | PACER + regulatory filings | 6-12 month litigation forecast | Pattern matching with historical case outcomes |

### 3. PROOF POINTS (ROI & Credibility Markers)

**Purpose:** Quantify business impact in dollars and specific outcomes.

**Bad (Vague):**
> "Our analysis helps companies make better decisions."

**Good (Specific ROI):**
> "Case Study: Mid-sized pharma identified gastrointestinal adverse event cluster 4 months before FDA MAUDE validation. Early label update prevented estimated $2.3M in regulatory response costs and maintained physician confidence during critical launch period."

**Formula:**

**ROI Templates by Vertical:**

**Healthcare:**
- Regulatory cost avoidance: $500K-$2M per early detection
- Market timing advantage: 6-month competitive window
- Physician confidence maintenance during critical periods

**SaaS:**
- Churn reduction: 15-25% (translates to $340K+ for $5M ARR company)
- Revenue retention: Address HIGH-priority gaps = 60-70% expansion capture
- Competitive window: 90-day first-mover advantage

**E-commerce:**
- Margin advantage: 58% vs 22% industry average (early inventory positioning)
- Inventory cost savings: Secure manufacturing before 40-80% cost spike
- Viral window capture: 30-45 days before mainstream awareness

**Real Estate:**
- Property value increases: $150K+ from 18-month early gentrification positioning
- Investment timing: Buy before 30-50% value appreciation
- Portfolio optimization: Identify undervalued neighborhoods systematically

### 4. URGENCY TRIGGERS (Why Act NOW vs. Later)

**Purpose:** Create time-pressure through competitive disadvantage or closing windows.

**Bad (No Urgency):**
> "This information could be helpful for your strategic planning."

**Good (Specific Urgency):**
> "Competitors monitoring same TikTok signals are likely positioning inventory NOW. 30-45 day window to secure manufacturing capacity before costs increase 40-80%. Delayed entry results in margin compression and competitive disadvantage."

**Formula:**

**Urgency Patterns by Vertical:**

**Healthcare:**
- "Your competitors detected this signal 6 months ago"
- "Next adverse event report could cost $2M+ in reactive response"
- "FDA MAUDE lag creates regulatory blindness - act before it's public"

**SaaS:**
- "Competitors reading your G2 reviews RIGHT NOW"
- "90-day competitive window closing - first mover captures 60-70% opportunity"
- "Feature gaps = churn triggers for your enterprise accounts"

**E-commerce:**
- "Viral products have 3-8 week positioning window before saturation"
- "Manufacturing costs spike 40-80% post-viral breakout"
- "Competitors securing inventory capacity NOW - 30-45 day window"

**Real Estate:**
- "Gentrification patterns visible 18-24 months early - window closing"
- "Property values increase 30-50% once mainstream awareness hits"
- "Early investors capture majority of appreciation - late movers get scraps"

**Legal:**
- "Litigation trends take 6-12 months to materialize - prepare now"
- "Competitor law firms likely analyzing same PACER data"
- "Proactive case strategy vs reactive = 3x better settlement outcomes"

### 5. IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE (WHO Makes the Purchase Decision)

**Purpose:** Speak directly to the actual buyer, not generic "businesses."

**Bad (Too Broad):**
> "For companies that need market intelligence."

**Good (Specific Buyer):**
> "VP of Pharmacovigilance or Chief Medical Officer at pharmaceutical companies with 2+ marketed drugs and $50M-$500M annual revenue."

**Formula:**

**ICP by Vertical:**

| Vertical | Job Title | Company Size | Pain Point |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Healthcare | VP Pharmacovigilance / Chief Medical Officer | Pharma $50M-$500M, 2+ marketed drugs | Regulatory surprises, competitive intelligence gaps |
| SaaS | Head of Product / VP Product Management | B2B SaaS $2M-$50M ARR, 50-500 customers | Feature prioritization uncertainty, churn risk |
| E-commerce | Amazon FBA Seller / DTC Brand Founder | $500K-$10M revenue, 5-50 SKUs | Inventory risk, late-market entry, margin compression |
| Real Estate | Real Estate Investor / REIT Portfolio Manager | $5M-$100M AUM, 10-100 properties | Market timing, undervalued neighborhood identification |
| Legal | Partner / Managing Attorney | Law firms $10M-$200M revenue, 20-200 attorneys | Litigation trend forecasting, resource allocation |
