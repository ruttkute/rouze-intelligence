                    You're losing deals and don't know why. Your competitor launched something new. 
                    Their marketing looks polished. Their pricing is aggressive.
                    <strong>But where are they actually vulnerable?</strong>

                    <li>Talk to salespeople who lost deals (emotional, unreliable)</li>
                    <li>Buy competitive analysis reports (generic, backward-looking)</li>
