## PART 2: DEPTH DESCRIPTIONS BY TIER

### TIER 1: Signal Discovery ($300-$800)
**What you get:**
- Surface-level sentiment analysis
- Trending signal identification
- 3-5 key findings extracted
- Quick market snapshot

**What it answers:**
- "What's happening in my market RIGHT NOW?"
- "Are customers happy with competitors?"
- "Which trends are gaining momentum?"

**Analysis depth:**
- Descriptive statistics only
- Raw data aggregation
- Basic trend spotting
- No forecasting

**Timeline:**
- 24-48 hours turnaround
- Fast-moving market decisions
- Initial market validation

**Who should choose this:**
- Startups validating market fit
- Product teams checking sentiment
- Marketing teams monitoring brand
- Quick decision-making needs

**Example insight:**
"Your competitor's latest product release generated 4,200 Reddit comments across 8 communities. Sentiment split: 62% positive (feature requests), 38% negative (pricing complaints). Trend: Customer demand for [feature] increasing 23% week-over-week. Market opportunity window: 30-60 days before competitors respond."

**ROI calculation:**
- Cost: $500
- Quick decision value: $10K-$50K (avoiding wrong product pivot)
- Break-even: Saves single bad decision

---

### TIER 2: Competitive Intelligence ($800-$2,000)
**What you get:**
- Multi-source cross-validation
- Competitor vulnerability mapping
- Positioning matrix analysis
- Strategic recommendations

**What it answers:**
- "What are competitors actually doing?"
- "Where are their vulnerabilities?"
- "What market position should we own?"

**Analysis depth:**
- Diagnostic analytics (why patterns exist)
- Statistical significance testing
- Comparative benchmarking
- Competitive positioning analysis

**Timeline:**
- 5-7 day deep dive
- Strategic decision-making
- Quarterly planning cycle

**Who should choose this:**
- Mid-market companies ($10M-$500M)
- Product strategy teams
- Marketing leadership
- Quarterly strategic reviews

**Example insight:**
"Analyzed 3,200 competitor reviews across G2, Trustpilot, and industry forums. Discovered: Competitor A has 43% of complaints about 'interface complexity' (your strength area). Competitor B's users paying 23% premium for 'reliability' (exploit this). Market positioning gap: 'Simple + Reliable' owned by nobody. Strategic recommendation: Position as [specific messaging], target [specific customer segment], expect 3-month competitive window before response."

**ROI calculation:**
- Cost: $1,200
- Strategic advantage value: $50K-$500K (improved positioning, higher conversion)
- Break-even: Single percentage point conversion lift

---

### TIER 3: Predictive Analysis ($2,000-$5,000)
**What you get:**
- Probability forecasting models
- Scenario planning (3 potential futures)
- Risk probability scoring
- Confidence intervals calculated

**What it answers:**
- "What WILL happen in the next 90 days?"
- "What's the probability of each outcome?"
- "Which risk scenario should we prepare for?"

**Analysis depth:**
- Predictive modeling (machine learning)
- Time series forecasting
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Bayesian probability inference

**Timeline:**
- 10-14 day modeling and validation
- Board-level decision support
- Strategic planning (6-12 month horizon)

**Who should choose this:**
- Enterprise leadership teams
- Investors analyzing markets
- Strategic planners with high stakes
- M&A due diligence situations

**Example insight:**
"Built demand forecasting model using 18-month historical data. Scenario 1 (probability 65%): Demand peaks at 18,400 units by Q4, then stabilizes. Scenario 2 (probability 25%): Competitor enters, demand drops 31% to 12,700 units. Scenario 3 (probability 10%): Market stalls completely, demand falls 65% to 6,300 units. Recommendation: Prepare inventory for Scenario 1 (65% likely), but hedge with production flexibility for Scenario 2 (25% risk). Expected financial impact: Correct scenario preparation saves $2.3M in inventory optimization."

**ROI calculation:**
- Cost: $3,500
- Probability-adjusted value: $500K-$5M+ (better strategic decisions)
- Break-even: Single quarter of better forecasting

---

### TIER 4: Enterprise Intelligence ($5,000-$20,000+)
**What you get:**
- Custom methodology development
- Proprietary competitive intelligence system
- Ongoing monitoring and alerts
- Strategic partnership and advisory

**What it answers:**
- "What's our sustainable competitive advantage?"
- "How do we transform market signals into systematic advantage?"
- "What should we monitor continuously?"

**Analysis depth:**
- Full stack: Predictive + prescriptive + strategic
- Optimization algorithms
- Network analysis and influence mapping
- Real-time monitoring infrastructure

**Timeline:**
- Custom project scope (typically 30-90 days)
- Quarterly business reviews
- Continuous intelligence flow

**Who should choose this:**
- Fortune 500 companies
- Private equity firms (portfolio monitoring)
- Venture capital (deal due diligence)
- Market leaders defending position

**Example insight:**
"Built proprietary monitoring system tracking 200+ signals across 15 data sources. Real-time alerts trigger when: competitor funding announced (probability-adjusted threat level), customer sentiment shifts 15% negatively (churn risk), new technology patterns emerge (disruption signal), regulatory changes impact compliance (legal risk). Custom dashboards show: competitive threat landscape (updated hourly), market opportunity pipeline (validated weekly), strategic risk assessment (probability-weighted scenarios). Monthly strategic advisory sessions interpret signals, recommend initiatives, anticipate market shifts. Expected impact: 18-month competitive intelligence advantage, early-warning system prevents $10M+ in reactive costs."

**ROI calculation:**
- Cost: $180,000 annually ($15K/month)
- Strategic advantage value: $5M-$50M+ (market leadership maintained)
- Break-even: Single major strategic decision made better

## PART 5: TIER SELECTION QUIZ LOGIC

Questions trigger tier recommendations based on answers:

**Q1: Timeline pressure** (How fast do you need answers?)
- "Today/tomorrow" → Tier 1 bias
- "This week" → Tier 1-2 bias
- "This month" → Tier 2-3 bias
- "Strategic horizon" → Tier 3-4 bias

**Q2: Decision stakes** (What's at risk?)
- "$50K or less" → Tier 1 bias
- "$100K-$500K" → Tier 2 bias
- "$1M-$10M" → Tier 3 bias
- "$10M+" → Tier 4 bias

**Q3: Information need** (What do you need to know?)
- "What's happening" → Tier 1
- "Why it's happening" → Tier 2
- "What will happen" → Tier 3
- "How to dominate" → Tier 4

**Q4: Analysis complexity** (How complex is your market?)
- "Simple/straightforward" → Tier 1
- "Moderately complex" → Tier 2
- "Very complex" → Tier 3
- "Extremely complex/multi-variable" → Tier 4

**Q5: Budget availability** (What's your budget?)
- "$300-$800" → Tier 1 required
- "$800-$2,000" → Tier 2 recommended
- "$2,000-$5,000" → Tier 3 recommended
- "$5,000+" → Tier 4 option

**Quiz algorithm:** Weight all 5 questions, calculate tier score, recommend tier with highest score. Show rationale for recommendation.
